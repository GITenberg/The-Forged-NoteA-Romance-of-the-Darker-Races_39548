<p>NOTES FROM THE JACKET DUSTCOVER OF THE FORGED NOTE:</p>

<p>It is sometimes asked what inspires
people to begin to write. Many reasons
may be given, but in this particular instance,
a brief statement of the author's
experiences might be of interest.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one he was a
homesteader on the Rosebud Indian
Reservation, South Dakota, where he was
about the only Negro settler. At twenty-six
he was prosperous; and when another
strip of the famous reservation was thrown
open to settlement, he helped some of
his relatives to secure land by furnishing
money with which to purchase relinquishments
on homesteads and other expenses.
He also secured for a young lady another
homestead, upon which she made filings.
Six months later they were married and
then went to live on her homestead.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of a minister in
one of the leading Negro churches and
was well educated, loved her husband devotedly&mdash;to
all appearances&mdash;and they
were happy.</p>

<p>Her father and husband represented
beings with different points of view, and
on this account an enmity grew up between
them. The husband had often
publicly criticised some of the leaders in
his race as not being sincere, particularly
many of the preachers. A year after the
marriage, the preacher paid his second
visit and when the husband was away, to
indicate his dislike for the pioneer, he
had his daughter, who was sick in bed,
forge her husband's name to a check for
a large sum, secured the money and took
his daughter to his home in Chicago.</p>

<p>The homestead had been contested previous
to this, and the minister had denounced
the white man (a banker), who
filed the contest, scathingly for trying to
beat his daughter out of her homestead.
Left alone after her departure, with only
his ninety-year-old grandmother, who
had raised a family in the days of slavery,
for company, Mr. Micheaux wrote his
first book. In the meantime, the case
dragged through all the land courts at
Washington, being finally settled by Secretary
of the Interior Lane in her favor.
About this time, the book appeared, and
was called "THE CONQUEST".</p>

<p>In this was told anonymously the story
of a base intrigue on the part of the
preacher to vent his spite. The white
banker, whose bank in the meantime had
failed, read the book, and understood....
He went to Chicago and sent the preacher
money to Cairo to come to Chicago, which
the preacher did. Although unsuccessful
in his effort before the government to
beat Mr. Micheaux's wife out of her
homestead, which had cost Mr. Micheaux
thirty-five hundred dollars and which at
that time was worth six thousand dollars,
the banker succeeded in having the
preacher persuade his daughter to sell
him the homestead, giving her in consideration,
only three hundred dollars.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

up on&mdash;it may be relinquished by the holder

woman, therefore, in this case could sell the homestead
without her husband's consent.</p></div>

<blockquote class="small"><p class="center">TO ONE WHOSE NAME DOES NOT APPEAR</p>


<p>I am leaving you and Dixie land tomorrow. It is customary perhaps
to say, "Dear Old Dixie" but, since I happen to be from that
little place off in the northwest, of which I have fondly told you,
the <i>Rosebud Country</i>, where I am returning at once, and which
is the only place that is dear to me, I could not conscientiously use
the other term. Still, I am grateful, and well I should be; for, had
I not spent these eighteen months down here, I could never have
written <i>this</i> story. No imagination, positively not mine, could have
created "Slim", "T. Toddy", "Legs", "John Moore", et al. I
really knew them. I haven't even changed their names, since what's
the use? They, unless by chance, will never know, for, as I knew
them, they never read. Only one of them I am sure ever owned a
book. That one did, however, and that I know, for he stole my
dictionary before I left the town. Whatever he expected to do with
it, is a puzzle to me, but since it was leather-bound, I think he
imagined it was a Bible. He was very fond of Bibles, and I recall
that was the only thing he read. He is in jail now, so I understand;
which is no surprise, since he visited there quite often in the
six months I knew him. As to "Legs", I have no word; but since
summer time has come, I am sure "Slim" has either gone into
"business" or is "preaching." "T. Toddy" was pretty shaky when
I saw him last, and I wouldn't be surprised if he were not now in
Heaven. And still, with what he threatened to do to me when he was
informed that I had written of him in a book, he may be in the other
place, who knows! I recall it with a tremor. We were in a restaurant
some time after the first threat, but at that time, he appeared
to understand that I had written nothing bad concerning him, and
we were quite friendly. He told of himself and his travels, relating
a trip abroad, to Liverpool and London. In the course of his
remarks, he told that he used to run down from Liverpool to London
every morning, since it was just over the hill a mile, and could be
seen from Liverpool whenever the fog lifted. He advised me a
bit remonstratingly, that, since I had written of him in the book,
if I had come to him in advance, he would have told me something
of himself to put into it that would have interested the world. I
suggested that it was not then too late, and that he should make
a copy of it. He intimated that it would be worth something and I
agreed with him, and told him I would give him fifty cents. He
said that would be satisfactory, but he wanted it then in advance.
I wouldn't agree to that, but told him that he would have to give
me a brief of his life, where and when he was born, if he had been,
also where and when he expected to die, etc. first. He got "mad"
then and threatened to do something "awful". Took himself
outside and opened a knife, the blade of which had been broken,
and was then about a half inch long, and told me to come out, whereupon
he would show me my heart. As he waited vainly for me,
he took on an expression that made him appear the worst man
in all the world. I did not, of course go out, and told him so&mdash;through
the window.</p>

<p>That was the end of it&mdash;and of him, so far as I know. But you
can understand by this how near I have been to death in your Dixie
Land. When I come back it will not be for "color"; but&mdash;well,
I guess you know.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_ONE" id="CHAPTER_ONE"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Barrier</i></p>


<p>He sat at a desk in the small office he had taken.
Before him were papers and bills&mdash;unpaid&mdash;and letters
too, he had not opened, while to one side were others he
had read, and had typed replies thereto. He had paused
in his work, and was gazing stupidly at the litter before
him.</p>

<p>His name was Sidney Wyeth, and his home was away
off in the great northwest, in a strip of territory known as
the <i>Rosebud Country</i>. As we meet him now, however, he
is located on the fifth floor of an office building, slightly
toward the outskirts of the business district of one of our
great American cities. He is by profession an author,
which might explain his presence at a desk. It happens,
however, that he is not there this time as a weaver of
dreams, but attending to matter in connection with the
circulation of his work, for he is his own publisher.</p>

<p>At that moment, however, he was nothing, for he
was sick. For days he had felt a strange illness. Obviously
it had almost reached an acute stage; for, apparently
unable to maintain an upright position at the desk,
he presently stretched himself face downward.</p>

<p>He might have been in this position an hour, or it might
have been only a few minutes; but of a sudden he was
brought to a position again erect, with ears alert, since
he was sure he had heard a sound without. He strained
his ears in silence.</p>

<p>Outside, a soft rain was falling. As he continued to
listen, his gaze wandered out over the city below, with
its medley of buildings that rose to various heights,
and sparkled with electric lights. His gaze, in drifting,
presently surveyed the main street of the city, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
unusually wide thoroughfare, filled with the accustomed
traffic. Beyond lay the harbor, for the city is a great
port, and the same was then filled with innumerable vessels
from far and near. A huge man-o-war arrested his
attention for a while, and then his gaze wandered further.
A wind had risen, from the way the water was dashed
to spray against the windows. The sound of a clock
striking five resounded through the damp air, and
echoed in stentorian tones. It was late-winter, but, due
perhaps to the overcast skies, twilight was rapidly
fading into darkness.</p>

<p>Failing to hear any further sound, he presently resumed
his tired position, and a few minutes later was lost in a
sickly slumber.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake now! A step sounded in
the hallway. It was a light step, but firm and brisk and
forward. It was unmistakably that of a young woman.
Onward it came in the direction of his small office.
There was a brief pause when the footsteps reached the
door, and then a knock, but without response from within.
Presently the door was pushed open, and the intruder
entered the room lightly. Still, Sidney Wyeth, unconscious
of the presence of his visitor, did not move or
speak.</p>

<p>The stranger paused hesitatingly, when once inside,
and observed him closely, where he sat with his face
buried in his arms.</p>

<p>She was an attractive colored girl, trimly dressed in a
striking, dark-blue tailored suit, cut in the latest fashion.
A small hat reposed jauntily upon her head, while a
wealth of dark hair was gathered in a heavy mass over
her ears. Her delicately molded face, set off by a figure
seemingly designed by an artist, were sufficient to captivate
the most discriminating critic.</p>

<p>A thin dark strap extended over one shoulder, at the
ends of which a small case was attached. Presently she
drew a book from this same case, and crossed the room
to where the man sat.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she ventured, pausing at his side,
and fumbling the book she had taken from the case, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
evident embarrassment. He mumbled something inaudible,
but remained silent. His outwardly indifferent
reception had not a discouraging effect upon his visitor,
however, for no sooner had she caught the sound of his
voice, than she fell into a concentrated explanation of
the book.</p>

<p>Soft and low, in spite of the rapid flow of words, her
voice fell upon his ears, and served to arouse him at last
from his apparent lethargy; but it was not that alone
which made him rise to a half sitting posture, and strain
his ears. It was a peculiar familiarity in the tone. As
he continued to listen, he became convinced that somewhere,
in the months gone by, he had heard that voice
before. "Where was it?" he whispered, but, in his
sluggish thoughts, he could not then recall. There was
one thing of which there was no doubt, however, and
which added strangely to the mystery. She was explaining
his own book, <i>The Tempest</i>.</p>

<p>At last, in his morbid thoughts, he gave up trying to
connect the voice with a person he had once known, and,
with a tired, long drawn sigh, raised his hand wearily
to his head, and grasped it as if in pain. The flow of
words ceased at once, and the voice now cried, with a
note of pain, and plainly embarrassed:</p>

<p>"You are ill and I have disturbed you! Oh, I'm <i>so</i>
sorry! Can you overlook&mdash;pardon such an awkward
blunder?" She clasped her hands helplessly, and was
plainly distressed. And then, as if seized with a sudden
inspiration, she cried, in a low, subdued voice: "I'll make
a light and bathe your forehead! You seem to have
fever!"</p>

<p>Turning nimbly, and before he could object, had he
wished to, she crossed quickly to where a small basin
hung from the wall; above this was an electric button,
which could be seen in the semi-darkness. Touching this,
whereupon the room became aglow with light, she
caught up a towel; and, dampening one end, she recrossed
to where he sat, strangely stupid, and, without
hesitation, placed the wet end over his burning forehead,
and held it there for possibly a minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," she inquired softly, in a tone of solicitous
relief, "do you feel better?"</p>

<p>As she concluded, she stepped where she could see his
face more easily, and sought his eyes anxiously. The
next moment, both recoiled in sudden recognition, as he
cried:</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>She was likewise astonished, and, after only a fraction
of a moment, but in which she regarded him with an
expression that was akin to an appeal, she likewise
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i>!" Quickly she became composed; and,
catching up the book, as though discovered in some
misdemeanor, with a hurried, parting glance, without
another word, she abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>She was gone, but his brain was in a tumult.</p>

<p>And then the illness, that had been hovering over him
for some time, like a sinister ghost, suddenly came into
its own, and a moment later, with a convulsive gasp, he
fell forward across the desk, deathly sick.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It had begun in Cincinnati more than a year before.
Wyeth, accompanied by an assistant, had come down from
Dayton for the purpose of advertising his book, <i>The
Tempest</i> in that city. It was just preceding an election,
that resulted in a change in the city government. And
it was then he became acquainted with Jackson.</p>

<p>Now, being of an observant turn of mind, Wyeth took
an interest in the state of affairs. He found the city very
much worked up on his arrival. He had not yet secured
accommodation, but, while standing on a corner after
checking his luggage in a nearby drug-store, he was gazing
up and down the street taking in the sights.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said someone, and turning, Wyeth and
his companion looked upon a man. He was a large
mulatto with curly hair, small eyes, a sharp nose, a firm
chin, and an unusually small mouth for a Negro. He was
dressed in a dark suit, the worse for wear, while his shoes
appeared never to have been shined&mdash;in fact, his appearance
was not altogether inviting. And yet, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
something about the man that drew Wyeth's attention,
and he listened carefully to what he said. "You seem
to be strangers in the city, and of co'se will requiah
lodgin'. He'ah is my ca'd," he said, extending the bit
of paste board upon which Sidney read at a glance</p>

<p class="center small">
THE JACKSON HOUSE
</p>
<p class="center smaller">FIRST CLASS ROOMS, TRANSIENT OR REGULAR</p>

<p class="center smallest">OPEN DAY AND NIGHT</p>

<p>"I'm the proprietor and the place is at yo' disposal.
Supposin' you stop with me while youah in the city.
I'll sho treat y' right."</p>

<p>Sidney believed him, but his appearance made him
hesitant. He looked questioningly at his companion.
The other's expression was unfavorable to Jackson. So,
after a pause and a perfunctory nod, they dismissed him
and proceeded to look further in quest of accommodation.</p>

<p>An hour or more was thus lost, and, being unable to
find a room that satisfied them, they at last, with some
reluctance, found their way to <i>The Jackson House</i>.</p>

<p>Inspection still left them dissatisfied, but it was getting
late, so they decided to spend the night. Jackson
showed them to what he termed his "best room." Wyeth
looked with evident disfavor about the walls that were
heavy with cob webs, while the windowsill was as heavy
with dust. Jackson, following his gaze, hastily offered
apology and excuse.</p>

<p>"Eve'thing needs a little dusting up, and the reason
you happen to find things as you do, is because I've
been so busy with politics of late, that I have jes' nach'elly
neglected my business".</p>

<p>Ah! That was it, thought Sidney. He had felt this
man was in some way out of the ordinary. "So you're a
politician?" he queried, observing him carefully now.</p>

<p>"You hit it, son," he chuckled. "Yeh; that's my line,
sho." Turning now, with his face wreathed in smiles,
he continued: "Big 'lection on in a few days, too."</p>

<p>"So I understand," said Sidney. "I shall be glad to
talk with you regarding the same at your convenience
later," and, paying him for the room, they betook themselves
to the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Election day was on, and Jackson was the busiest man
in town. He was what may be called a "good mixer,"
to say the least, and Sidney and he had become good
friends. So said Jackson that morning.</p>

<p>"Got a big job on t'day, kid; yeh, a big job."</p>

<p>"So...."</p>

<p>"Yeh; gotta vote thirty-five ah fo'ty nigga's, 'n', 'f
youah 'quainted wi' ouh fo'kes, you c'n 'preciate what
I'm up ag'inst."</p>

<p>"Indeed...."</p>

<p>"Yeh; nigga's o'nry y' know; and lie lak dogs; but
I'm 'n' ole han' at the bus'ness, cause that's my line.
Yeh. Been votin' nigga's in this precinct now fo' mor'n
thi'ty yeahs, so you'n see I autta know what I'm 'bout."</p>

<p>"I'd bet on that."</p>

<p>Jackson chuckled again. "The fust and wo'st difficulty
is the dinge's ig'nance". Drawing a sample ballot from
somewhere, he displayed and explained it at some length.
"Now we gotta pu'ty faih line up on this ticket this
trip&mdash;'co'se the's a lotta suckers on it that I'd lak t' see
scratched; but we cain' affo'd to take the risk, 'cause it's
lak this. Nigga's so ig'nant 'n' pig headed they'd sho
spile it all 'f we tried to have them do any scratching.
So the only sho thing is to instruct them t' vote straight.
Get me, Steve?"</p>

<p>Wyeth, listening carefully, nodded, and for a moment,
a picture of the titanic struggle of a half century before,
rose before him; its cause, its moral and more; it's
sacrifice. Jackson was speaking again.</p>

<p>"Now we sho gotta win out this time; this 'lection has
<i>got</i> to put in ouh candidates; 'cause 'f we don't&mdash;and this
is between me 'n' you 'n' that can a beah&mdash;things sho
go'n break bad wi' me! But 'f things slide through O.K.&mdash;'n
my candidates walk in, it means a cole hund'd
fo' muh; think of it," he repeated, "a cole hund'd, Ah!"
And, smacking his lips after a long draught of beer, he
emitted an exclamation to emphasize what it <i>would</i>
mean to him, that wouldn't look very nice in print.</p>

<p>"What do these <i>others</i> get if your candidates are
elected?" asked Wyeth, when Jackson paused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw, <i>them</i> suckers gets theahs wether my men's 'lected
a' not. That's always my goal. 'f I could get them t'
vote so much ah' nothin' I could make a who' lot mo';
but we gotta fo'k out two dollahs a piece, win or lose&mdash;and,
a co'se, plenty of liquah; but we don' give a damn 'bout
that, as the saloon men furnish that, gratis."</p>

<p>"And you can depend upon them to vote as you wish&mdash;rather,
instruct?" ventured Wyeth. At this Jackson
gave a low, short laugh as he replied:</p>

<p>"That's whe' I plays the high ca'd 'n' gets a hund'd,"
and, laughing again in that peculiar fashion, he would
say no more.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The polls had closed. Darkness had settled over the
city. The saloons had opened their doors. From the
streets came forth hilarious sounds, where the many hundreds,
now steeped in liquor, reeled about. This confusion,
mingled with the crash of heavy wagons, and horse
hoofs hurrying over the cobblestones, filled the damp
air with an almost deafening noise.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth lay stretched across the bed in his room,
listening idly to the sounds that echoed and re-echoed
through the frame building. Presently, his attention was
attracted by another noise, familiar, but more noticeable
on this day.</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-ilick&mdash;ah&mdash;ha dice! T-click-ilick-i-lick&mdash;ah&mdash;ha
dice!"</p>

<p>"Aw, shake'm ole nigga, shake'm!"</p>

<p>"Cain' make eight wid a one up!"</p>

<p>"Gimme d' craps!"</p>

<p>"Now, dice; ah-seben ah 'leben!"</p>

<p>"Throwed craps!"</p>

<p>"Hole on! Hole on! You caught dem dice, ole nigga!"</p>

<p>"Caught Hell! You trowed craps, d'y 'e heah! Two

ensued.</p>

<p>"Say, cut out dis awgun' 'n' squabblin'," interposed
one.</p>

<p>"'E cain' take mah money lak dat," protested the loser.</p>

<p>"'F you don' git y' rough mit offa dat coin, yuh big

<p>"Youse a cheap nigga, Bad Eye, 'n' y' know it. You
all time buttin' int' a game wid about a dime, den sta'tin'

<p>"Hush! Ain' dat Jackson a-comin'?"</p>

<p>Silence for possibly a minute. A muttering began to
go around as they schuffled about.</p>

<p>"Ah done ca'ied out mah 'structions 'n' now ah wants
muh dough-rine," some one spat out ominously.</p>

<p>"Me, too," said another.</p>

<p>"Aw, be patient. Jack's all right," argued one.</p>

<p>"Sho", echoed another.</p>

<p>"Yeh, dat' all right, 's fur it goes; but I'n handle mah
money bet'n anybody else."</p>

<p>A heavy step sounded in the hallway, and presently a
door opened into the room, admitting Jackson.</p>

<p>"All heah, boys, eh!" He said in a voice that revealed
high spirits. "Good&mdash;what's this? Havin' a little game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
already? Say! Looks like y' might a-waited fo' old Jack,
ha ha!"</p>

<p>"Well," he resumed after a general laughing, "Did
eve' body vote straight?"</p>

<p>"Sho", they cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"N' how 'bout you, little breeches."</p>

<p>"Ke-heh! You say. 'Stamp ri' undah da' ole elephant's
tail'; so when I got 'nside da' place wi one a dem ballets,
'n' all dem names ah did'n' know nothin' 'bout; but I
'memb'd what you say, so I jes' caught hole that li'l ole
thing 'n' went, bim! ri' unda' da' ole elephant's tail,
ya-ha!" The room, for a time, resounded with laughter.</p>

<p>Just then, Wyeth heard someone rap at the street door,
enter, and presently the counting and the clink of coins
came to his ears. Then the door closed, and a moment
later, retreating foot steps were heard in the hall-way.
It was the lieutenant. And now the gurgle of throats
could be heard plainly, and the game was resumed, with
Jackson in charge.</p>

<p>In the other room, Wyeth stripped himself and retired,
and, ere sleep came to him that night, he again had a
vision of that titanic struggle and its human slaughter&mdash;and
it had all been to give those black men the right. (?)
Far into the night he thought it over, and when sleep did
come at last, he went into slumberland, at a loss to know
whether to condemn or to pity those poor creatures, who,
that day&mdash;and before&mdash;had sold their birthright for a
mess of pottage.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Weeks had passed. Over all the north country, snowladen
fields frowned. Zero weather was felt in many
places. Sidney Wyeth was about to quit it for a place
far to the south, and at that moment, sat in the union
station at Columbus. A man marked with a chalk upon
the bulletin board the following:</p>

<p class="center">TRAIN FOR CINCINNATI AND THE SOUTH, TWO HOURS LATE</p>

<p>And it was only then it occurred to him that a letter
might be at the postoffice for him. Forthwith he betook
himself, returning shortly with a small envelope, with
his name written daintily across it in a feminine hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
It was from Mildred Latham, the girl he loved, and the
heroine of our story.</p>

<p>"Mildred, my Mildred!" he whispered softly, as he
gazed fondly at the epistle, and then broke the seal and
read it. "Tonight, my dear," he dreamily whispered, "I
shall ask you to become my wife, for I love you, love
you, love you!"</p>

<p>As he sat waiting, his thoughts went back to the time
he had met her, and the place.</p>

<p>It was in Cincinnati, and before the election. He had,
while canvassing, come upon her in the door-way of a
house with two stories, and a door that opened upon the
street. She stood in that door-way, and he had approached
her with much courtesy, and after his usual explanation,
had sold her <i>The Tempest</i>. He had been struck at
once by her appearance, and something about her expression&mdash;her
obvious intelligence. She seemed possibly
twenty-one or two. "And such features," he breathed
unheard. She also had, he quickly observed, a wonderful
skin&mdash;a smooth, velvety olive, with round cheeks;
where, notwithstanding the slight darkness, a faint flush
came and went. As to size, she was not tall; and still
not short; nor was she stout or slender; but of that indefinite
type called medium. Serenely perched, her head
leaned slightly back. She had a frank face and rounded
forehead, from under which large, lustrous, soft dark eyes&mdash;somewhat
sad&mdash;gazed out at him. And as he continued
in his subtle observation, he was pleased to note that her
nose was not large or flat, but stood up beautifully. Her
lips were red as cherries. The chin was handsomely
molded and firm, but slightly thin, and protruding.
Her hair was the most captivating of all. Done in the
fashion, it was coal black and wavy. It was of a fine,
silken texture, and apparently long, from the size of the
knot at the back of her head. All this he observed with
favor. He had never seen a figure so clear cut. The girl
was, furthermore, dressed in a plain, dark silk dress, with
small feet, the toes of which, at that moment, peeped like
mice from beneath the trimly hanging skirt. Now, before
he had gotten far in his dynamic spiel, the sun, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
red and glorious, as its rays slanted in the west, came suddenly
from beneath a cloud, and played hide and seek
upon her face. And, in that moment, he saw that she
was exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>After this, he had seen her when, and however it was
convenient, and they had talked&mdash;they always talked&mdash;on
so very many subjects. As time went by, he always
felt good cheer, for at last, it seemed&mdash;and this meant
much, for Sidney Wyeth had had much experience&mdash;he
had met the One Woman.</p>

<p>One day she said to him, and it was in a tone that was
very careful: "You wrote <i>The Tempest</i>, didn't
you?" She had guessed his secret, although the book
had been published anonymously&mdash;and he had always
been guarded as to its author, so he replied somewhat
awkwardly that he had.</p>

<p>"I felt it&mdash;was sure when I began reading," she said.
"Because there is something in it about you that you
never tell&mdash;in conversation, but you did in the book."</p>

<p>He was silent, for he knew not what to say at that
moment. She resumed:</p>

<p>"Yes; and it is that which makes the book <i>so</i> interesting&mdash;and
so sad." She fell silent then for a time,
apparently engrossed in deep thought, but with worried
and sad expression.</p>

<p>There were other times she had appeared sad; times
when he felt she could have been happy and cheerful and
gay. And that to him was ever a mystery. He wished
he could help her out of that way&mdash;at any time....
Some day he would, too. He was firm in this....</p>

<p>Then came the time when he was to leave, and he passed
her way that day. From across the street she saw him,
and came at once with hands outstretched; but when
he made known the fact of his proposed departure, she
was downcast, and sorrowful and sad.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> sorry," she said&mdash;and meant it. He was too,
and said nothing.</p>

<p>"I shall miss you&mdash;oh, ever so much."</p>

<p>"I will you, too," he whispered. She looked up quickly,
but what she saw in his eyes made her as quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
turn away. They entered the house and the parlor
where it was dark for day-time, and sat together for a
long while in silence. Presently, from the next house
came the notes of a piano, and some one sang <i>Sweet
Genevieve</i>. O, subtle art! It made them both feel sad.
Impulsively he arose and caught her in his arms, when
the music had changed to <i>The Blue Danube</i>. Around
then, and around they waltzed, light-footed to the sweet
old tune. And as they danced, both seemed to become
strangely infected with a wild exhilaration. Entranced,
he unconsciously sought her eyes with an awakening
passion, and saw that she had been transformed by the
music, and perhaps the dance, into a wild, elfin-like
creature, and he looked away.</p>

<p>Minutes went by like seconds and, after a time, he
dared seek her eyes again, only to see that she had
grown more elfin still. And, as abruptly as it had begun,
the music stopped, and their dance ceased. They stood,
however, as though forgetting the embrace, and thus
heard each others hearts thump violently. One moment
they stood thus, and then a breath of wind through the
open window, lifted a stray lock of her hair and laid it
against his cheek. He was intoxicated by its effect, and
then suddenly he had lost all composure. He crushed
her to him, close, closer, and, in bold defiance of all
conventionality, he kissed her lips&mdash;once, twice, three
times! She was not angry, but struggled, nevertheless,
to be free. She heard his voice then, low, strained,
palpitating, and with soul on fire: "Mildred!" Again
he cried, "Mildred! O, my Mildred!" She swayed helplessly.
"I&mdash;&mdash;", but she got no further. He had
caught sight of her eyes, helpless; but with a weak
appeal, as her lips faltered:</p>

<p>"Please don't!" And in spite of his mad desire, and
the words he could have then sung like the poets, he
hesitated, and for some reason, for which he could not
quite fully account, allowed her to disengage herself.</p>

<p>Freed now, she took several steps, and when at some
distance she paused, and regarded him with forced
defiance; but behind it, he caught again that sad dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>traction.
"What is it," he uttered, almost aloud. And
then, intuitively, he knew she was unhappy&mdash;aye, miserable.
"I must help her," said he beneath his breath;
but before he had decided how, he seemed to hear a
voice saying: "No, not yet because,&mdash;well, <i>you</i> can't!"</p>

<p>The strains of music again came floating through the
open window. He was not aware of his gaze; but something
in his expression seemed to inspire her confidence;
for, involuntarily she turned and started in his direction.
She took only a step or two, when she abruptly halted;
paused hesitatingly, uncertainly, with her thin lips compressed,
hands clinched, and her head thrown back in an
obvious effort. But her throat swelled almost to choking,
as she withheld something she seemed mad to say. An
expression of superhuman effort seemed suddenly to be
exerted, and suddenly whirling, without a word, she
silently quit the room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He was aroused now from his revery by "All a-bo-ar-d:
Cincinnati and the South," and an hour later, he was
whirling southward over snowladen fields to his Arcadia.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Cincinnati rose about him at eight o'clock that evening,
as he emerged from the union station and started on his
fateful quest. The snow, ground to slush by thousands of
wheels, made the hard streets filthy. He scurried across,
and caught a car that took him within two blocks of
where she lived. Progress was slow, but only seemingly,
for he was so impatient. It seemed fully an hour before he
left it, although it was not fifteen minutes. Along the
poorly lighted street he rushed in breathless haste. His
heart kept up a tattoo that disturbed him, and he heard
himself muttering: "Sidney Wyeth, what's the matter?
Why do you feel this way? Pshaw! You ought surely to
be happy, calm and imperious. Mildred Latham loves
you&mdash;and she needs you; but much she does with such
nerves!" He braced himself as he neared the house, and
pictured himself in the next hour. She would be in his
arms&mdash;and all would be over&mdash;but the happiness. This
picture became so vivid, that for a time it served to
make him forget his nerves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>And now he had come unto the house, the house of his
treasure, and within all was silent. Strangely, a feeling
came over him of an approaching doom. Before him,
shivering in the cold night, sat an old woman, a hag. She
looked at him out of one evil old eye, and he shuddered
noticeably. She was uncouth and unwelcome. "What's
she doing here?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss Mildred Latham live here?" He
ventured at last.</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped the hag, and appeared more evil still.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he murmured with forced courtesy, but
very uneasy. Drawing his card, he held it out to her,
with: "Kindly take this and inform her that a gentleman&mdash;a
friend&mdash;would be glad to speak with her." The
old hag crushed it in her bony palm, and spat out five
short words.... But, oh, what mean, cruel, hurting
little words!</p>

<p>He reeled in spite of his strength, then stood like a
statue, frozen to the spot.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and dark and dreary; but to
Sidney Wyeth it was hot&mdash;suffocating in those next
moments. His jaw dropped as he started to speak, but
the words failed to come. After a time, the elements began
to clear, but left him weak. He turned with a savage
gripping at his heart, and stumbled back in the direction
from whence he had come.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mildred!" he wailed. "Mildred, Mildred! I
can't believe it.... I can never, oh, never&mdash;&mdash;and
I loved you so!" On and on he went; at times walking,
other times stumbling; but always uttering incoherent
sentences. "It can't be true&mdash;it <i>isn't</i> true! That old
hag&mdash;spiteful creature," he now growled distractedly,&mdash;"lied!
I'll go back, curse her! I'll go back and prove
her the liar she is." He halted, staggered drunkenly
against a building, and then abruptly turned his face in
the direction from whence he had come. But, 'ere he
had gone far, he desisted. Believe those words or not,
something forbade this step. Weaker than ever, torn,
distracted, and mentally prostrated, he paused and leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
against a building, and for a long time gave up to utter
misery.</p>

<p>Our pen fails here to describe fully those conflicting
moments. All that he had lived for in those days,
and all that he had recently hoped for, seemed to have
been swept forever from him in that one moment. After
an interminable spell of mental blankness, a sentence he
had once been fond of quoting, and which he had taken
from Haggard's <i>Pearl Maiden</i>, came back to him out of a
remote past. It was this: "With time, most men become
used to disaster and rebuff. A colt that seems to break its
neck at the crack of a whip, will hobble at last to the
knacker, unmoved from a thousand blows rained upon
him." So, presently, with a tired, wearied sigh, he gathered
himself together, and, with a last despairing look in
the direction of the fateful number, he passed down the
dark street, and disappeared in the direction of The
Jackson House.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Wonder what's the matter wi' d' kid t'night?" said
Jackson to his consort, as she looked up inquiringly when
he re-entered the room, after showing Wyeth to his bed.</p>

<p>"I wonder", she commented thoughtfully. "He's
always so cheerful and pleasant when around. He
walked in here like a ghost tonight. Now I wonder what
is the matter?"</p>

<p>It was late the following morning when Jackson chanced
to be passing, and peeped into the room occupied by his
friend, who had acted so strangely the night before. The
coverlets had not been turned back, altho the bed was
sunk in the middle, as if someone had tossed restlessly
about over it the night before. Jackson wondered again.
But at that hour, Sidney Wyeth was on a train that was
speeding southward into Dixie.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So it happened that the hero of this story went
forth into a land which is a part of our country....
A part wherein people and environment are so far
different from the rest, that a great problem is
ever an issue. This is the problem of human beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
versus human beings. A land wherein one race vies with
the other; that other being a multitude of black people,
and, as one who reads this might know, a people who,
once upon a time had been slaves, chattels, and who
for fifty and a few years have been free. That time,
however, has not been, as we might appreciate, sufficient
to eliminate many things hereditary.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And what came to pass upon this journey; the things
he discovered, the one he again met, of what had resulted,
due to the machinations of a pious, evil genius, is the
story I have to tell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TWO" id="CHAPTER_TWO"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Attalia</i></p>


<p>"Heah! Heah! Don't get on that cah!" cried the
conductor the following morning, as Sidney Wyeth was
climbing aboard the Jim Crow car of the <i>Palm Leaf
Limited</i>, bound for Attalia. He backed up and looked
about him in some surprise, and than demanded the
reason why he shouldn't get aboard that "cah".</p>

<p>"I thought I tole you once we had an extra heavy
train, and no colored passengers allowed; but since I see
yu', now I see you ain't the same fellah that was here
awhile ago." And then, in a few words, he explained
that, owing to the rush of people to the south during
those first days of January, the Jim Crow section of the
train had been dispensed with for that day. He explained
further that a second section of the same train would
follow shortly. As it would, in all probability, pass them
at Lexington, Sidney, with a mumble of thanks, gathered
up his grips and returned to the waiting room, catching
the same an hour later.</p>

<p>Kentucky soon lay before him. As far as eye could
see, a snowy mantle covered the ground, for it was winter.
Presently, countless rows of frame buildings appeared.
A new brick station, which extended for some length
along the track, gave the traveler welcome.</p>

<p>When the train came to a stop, Sidney's attention was
arrested by the sight of a creature that may have been
called a man, but gave every evidence of being an ape.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said he, to a fellow passenger, "do those
things grow 'round here?"</p>

<p>They both enjoyed a laugh.</p>

<p>He was now in a land in which a portion of the people,
apparently, possessed little sense of humor, judging from
the way his jokes were accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>On the car were two women, among the half dozen or
so colored passengers. Sidney overheard one of them say
to the other:</p>

<p>"I'm from No'th C'lina; but I be'n in Oklahoma two
ye's. I'm go'n back home t' stay. Whe' you from?"</p>

<p>"Tennessee, Knoxville. I'm livin' in Bloomington,
Illinois, now."</p>

<p>They looked inquiringly in the direction of Wyeth, and
presently he was drawn into the conversation. The latter
possessed fine sense of humor, and when he found these
people so serious, he took delight in joking.</p>

<p>"Whe' you from?" they inquired, with all that is
southern and hospitable in their tone.</p>

<p>"From the <i>Rosebud Country</i>, South Dakota," he replied.
Their faces were a study. Somewhere in the years gone
by they might have heard of that state in school, but
the <i>Rosebud Country</i> was Greek to them.</p>

<p>"O-oh," they echoed, and then looked at each other
and back at him. Presently one of them inquired:
"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"In Africa," he answered, but they did not catch the
joke, and to this day, they speak of the man they met
from the Dark Continent.</p>

<p>At that moment, the train was crossing a stream over
the highest bridge Sidney had ever seen, with possibly
one or two exceptions. It seemed a thousand feet to the
crystal water below, and every eye was fixed upon it.
The porter, a long, lank, laughing creature, scion of the
south and <i>some</i> porter, seeing an opportunity to draw
attention, rushed up in a Shakesperian pose, and related
dramatically, the incident of an intoxicated man, who,
while crossing that very stream, fell, of a sudden, smack
dab over-board, right into it. In concluding, he looked
about him more dramatically than ever, as the many
"O-ohs," and "Mys!" greeted his terrible story. And
Sidney Wyeth, with eyes wide open, inquired if he got wet.</p>

<p>"Jes' listen at that," they cried in chorus, and the joke
was lost.</p>

<p>Down, down the train whirled into the bowels of Dixie.
Far away to the east, rising gray and ghostlike above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
mists, the pine covered Cumberland Range appeared and
reappeared in the distance. Outlined like grim sentinels,
the scene, to the hero of this story, recalled the many
tragedies of which those mountains were the back-ground.
The moon-shiners, the feudists, the hill-billies and the
rough-necks, always had a haven there.</p>

<p>The puffing of many, many locomotives, the sight of
buildings, and the glare of electric lights gave evidence
that they had reached a large city. Chattanooga, city
of southern trunk lines, and railroad center, now greeted
his eye.</p>

<p>He spent one night there, and the next day, resumed
his journey toward that most conspicuous of all southern
towns, Attalia. It was a hundred and fifty miles and
more by rail. The train became more crowded as it neared
his destination, while the people grew more cosmopolitan.
One of these, a black man, entered at one of the many
stations, and greeted Wyeth pleasantly, inquiring where
he was headed for. Wyeth answered Attalia, and his
companion became very sociable.</p>

<p>"Understand," said Wyeth, after a moment&mdash;the other
had possessed himself of a portion of the seat upon which
he sat&mdash;"that Attalia is one of the best towns in the
south, and has one of the finest stations in the country."</p>

<p>"La'gest 'n' finest in the wo'ld," said the other, with a
show of pride. He was a resident of the state of which
Attalia was the capital, and was, furthermore, a preacher.
Wyeth didn't care to argue, so let it <i>be</i> the largest and
said:</p>

<p>"That's wonderful! I hear also, that it is a great
commercial center as well, and that the city is growing
like a mushroom."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh," said he. "Out-side Noo Yo'k, it's the
busiest and best town in the United States. Yes, yeh,"
he went on thoughtfully, "Attalia is sho a mighty city.
Eve' been theah?"</p>

<p>"Not for more than ten years," replied Sidney.</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, well, I mus' say you'll ha'dly recognize
it as the same."</p>

<p>They were now approaching the embryo city. Clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of smoke, and the whistling of innumerable locomotives
filled the air. Wyeth began making preparation to leave
the train, when the other touched him, saying: "No
hurry, my deah suh, no hurry. Be's a long time yet
befo' we 'rives in de station, be's a long time yet."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" the other exclaimed, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, Attalia's a mighty city, a great city. Wait until
you see Plum street 'n' the sky-scrapers."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the train had arrived, and stood outside the
station, through which it had just passed. It was indeed
a large and imposing structure. As it rose behind them,
under the bright sunlight, with its many cornices glittering
as so many diamonds, it was truly a city pride. From
where the train stood, the city lay like a great scroll, and
vanished in the distance. Smoke and dust filled the air,
and hovered over the medley of buildings like a dull, red
cloud. Rising in uncertain lines, as if to escape the
gloom, a line of sky-scrapers appeared in the background.
"Those must be on Plum street," mused Sidney,
as he looked about for a conveyance.</p>

<p>Besides being the capital of the state, and the greatest
commercial city southeast of the Mississippi, Attalia is
the city of conventions, the southern center for insurance,
a progressive journalistic city, and a uniform town. It is
also a center for the education of Negroes, since it has a
number of colleges supported by northern philanthropy.
Yet the city is unable to maintain a proficient and complete
course of education for its many colored children.
Unfortunately for the Negroes, when the white schools
are amply provided for, not enough is left for the proper
training of its black population, which constitutes one-third
of the whole.</p>

<p>Sidney did not fail to take note of the fact, as he
passed through the station, that, contrary to previous
reports, the colored waiting room was cleanly kept,
almost as well as that of the white race. White-coated
flunkies flitted about nimbly in prompt attention to the
weary traveler, in spite of an air of sleepiness.</p>

<p>Presently, Wyeth made inquiry regarding conveyance.
No sooner had he done so, than he was deluged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
solicitations from a score or more cabmen, who seemed
literally to raise out of the floor. They would take him
in jig-time anywhere he wanted to go.</p>

<p>"But that's it," he said in a confused tone. "I don't
know exactly where I want to go."</p>

<p>"Deed, suh, I c'n take yu' any wha', jes' any wha' 'f
you'll jes' name de place."</p>

<p>Not being able, apparently, to make him understand
that he was a stranger, unacquainted with the city, he
presently settled on the charge, bundled in, and ordered
to be taken to the best colored neighborhood, and in a
few minutes he was being trundled on his way.</p>

<p>They turned into a street, after a block or two, that
happened to be one end of the leading business thoroughfare.
On a corner post, Sidney read Walthill. The cab
took him up this street, surrounded on either side with
the many busy shops and people, and it continued until
a viaduct was reached. Attalia's broadway was just
ahead. It was a wide street, and yet not wide enough.
It had been made wider recently, and in making it so,
the sidewalks had perforce been made narrower. They
had not been sufficiently wide before, and now this threw
many pedestrians into the street, where they walked along
much slower than in Cincinnati even. As the cab rolled
along, Sidney observed that the street was considerably
wider after some distance, and this was the business
section. To the right and to the left, in fact in every
direction, buildings, brick and stone, concrete, stucco and
an occasional frame, stood, here low, there high, and still
higher, even to twenty stories. As he looked, the setting
sun played subtly about the topmost peaks. Presently,
the cab turned into Audubon Avenue.</p>

<p>This street sloped down hill for many blocks, and when
the cab had made its abrupt turn further on, Sidney
observed a large, red, brick building with stone cornices
rising skyward. Adjoining this, he caught a glimpse of
the outline of still another building, apparently unfinished.
Strangely enough, he felt this to be the property of black
people. On down the street the cab rolled.</p>

<p>It was a street quite wide enough, and paved in part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
with cobble stones, and further on with asphalt. Glancing
from right to left, as he proceeded, he saw that it was
given over largely to business conducted by Negroes,
Jews, Italians and Greeks.</p>

<p>Presently, his wandering gaze took in the proportions
of a small book shop, before which stood a tall, lean
Negro, whom he surmised rightly to be the proprietor.
In the window, displayed conspicuously and artistically,
were numerous books by Negro authors which he had
read, and, of course, some he had not.</p>

<p>And still he was trundled on. His gaze met the sight
of a mammoth stone church, where he saw many colored
men standing about the front. Some were brown, while
others were yellow, and still others were almost white.
They were preachers, he knew, for all were fat. Only
preachers were always so, he recalled, and that's why
he knew. Across another street and on the same side,
they came abreast of the structure that had arrested his
attention before. The first portion rose to only two
stories, but was so artistically constructed, that it caught
his attention, and commanded his admiration. Next
to this, the other portion reached to six stories, and,
as he came to the front, he viewed it very carefully.
On one side of a wide entry, over which was written
many words which he could not decipher, was a first
class barber shop where black men were being shaved.
On the other side, a bank occupied much space, and this,
he observed, for the first time in his life, was conducted
by black people&mdash;no, they were between and betwixt,
but that does not matter, they belonged to that race.
At the rear he saw elevators moving to and fro, while
the entry was filled with these same folk. His bosom
swelled at the sight, for he was proud of his people.</p>

<p>"Heah's a place you might look ovah, deah brudder,"
said the cabman at last, as he halted before an old frame
structure, across the front of which was written in large
letters</p>

<p class="center">THE BIXLEY HOUSE</p>

<p>Sidney was not favorably impressed.</p>

<p>"How you lak it?" asked the cabman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nix," he replied. "Try another."</p>

<p>The horse was turned about, and they journeyed back
over the same street from whence they had come. Two
blocks were thus covered, and then they turned into
a street that intersected, and stopped before another
place less impressive looking. At this point, the cabman
suggested a lady friend of his, who kept nice rooms, and
to this he was straightway driven. He was satisfied at
last, paid his fee, and in due time was fairly well installed.</p>

<p>Sometime later, Sidney went forth on a tour of inspection.
The first place he decided to visit was the
book store, where he had seen the serious looking man at
the front. He turned out to be so, very much so, as
Sidney learned in after months. His name was Tompkins,
and he was very affable, even pleasant.</p>

<p>"A-hem. Glad to know you, Mr. Wyeth," he said,
accepting the introduction. When Sidney stated the
nature of his business, he answered his many questions
very pompously, and further said, that the colored people
of the city had an inclination for literature.</p>

<p>Sidney, however, began to feel, after more questioning,
that Tompkins was stretching things, and that his statement,
that the colored people were great readers, was
largely exaggerated. It was, as we shall see later; but
for the present, he thanked Tompkins, and promised to
drop in again.</p>

<p>When he had dined at one of the many little restaurants,
he wandered back into the business section of the city.
He failed to recognize any of the places he had once
known, which proved conclusively that Attalia had
progressed. He found himself on Plum street again,
through which he walked and reentered Walthill, and,
after seeing many of the sights, entered a large book store,
where he inquired for a volume he had long desired to
read&mdash;rather, he inquired of a large, fat man, whether he
had it. The other looked around a spell, then replied:</p>

<p>"We sho God has," and stood waiting undecidedly.
Presently he held it toward Wyeth, who, somewhat
hesitatingly, looked irrelevantly through the pages. He
was not sure, whether it was customary to take it in his
hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," he said, and reached in his pocket for the
money.</p>

<p>"Do you-ah&mdash;wish it?" the other inquired, still
hesitating.</p>

<p>"Sure," Sidney replied. "That's why I called for it."
He was obviously surprised, and expressed the fact in his
eyes. The other observed this, and made haste to
apologize:</p>

<p>"Ce'tainly, ce'tainly. Beg yo' pa'don. Not many
cullud people buy works of fiction, or anything besides
an occasional Bible, school books and stationery. That
is why I was undecided whether you wanted to buy it
or not."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" echoed Sidney, taken suddenly aback. Then
said: "I read a great deal myself."</p>

<p>The clerk observed him closely for a moment, and then
said: "You don't live in these parts?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you read a great deal? Where are you from?"</p>

<p>He was told.</p>

<p>"That accounts for it," said the other, proceeding to
wrap up the book.</p>

<p>"Accounts for what?" curiously.</p>

<p>"Your being a reader."</p>

<p>"I don't understand.... Don't the colored people down
here read a great deal also?"</p>

<p>"No," said the other simply.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" said Sidney in surprise. "I have
only two hours or less ago, been told by a book-seller
that they do."</p>

<p>"Lordy me! Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Tompkins. The&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tompkins is a booster. He's all right, though," said
the other, with a low, amused laugh. But Sidney's
curiosity was aroused, and he continued:</p>

<p>"There's a multitude of teachers and preachers, and I
should think they would buy lots of current literature to
keep themselves informed for their work; but perhaps
they are not so well paid, and get it from the library."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The other appeared perplexed for a moment, but said
presently, without looking up:</p>

<p>"They have no library of their own, and the city
library is not open to colored people, but they do not
seem to be very anxious for books. The teachers, and
the preachers&mdash;" He threw up his hands in a gesture
of despair. "You'll find out for yourself. You are, I see,
a keen observer, and you'll find out."</p>

<p>Sidney left the store in a reflective frame of mind.
"I didn't believe Tompkins," he muttered, as he walked
back in the direction of Audubon Avenue. Just then
he glanced to his left, into the largest barber shop he had
ever seen. It was for white people, but conducted by a
colored man. It was not only the largest he had ever seen,
but the finest, the most artistic. He forgot, for the time,
what he had just been told, and which was causing him
some concern, and again he felt his breast swell.</p>

<p>There was much to be learned about his people that
he now realized he did not know; and yet, surrounding
it all was a peculiar mystery that he decided to solve for
himself. He did so, but that remains to be told.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_THREE" id="CHAPTER_THREE"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Next Day&mdash;Discoveries</i></p>


<p>At eight-thirty the following morning, Sidney set forth,
carrying a small case containing a half dozen books. His
purpose was to feel out the city from a practical point of
view. He had been told that the better class of Negroes
could be found by walking down Audubon Avenue, as
far as the residence section. So he followed it until the
business had been left blocks to the rear. At the end of
the paved street he turned into a house. It was a very
sumptuous affair, with an attractive lawn before it. He
was told by a passerby that it was the home of a club
waiter. He ventured up to the front door, and, upon its
being opened by a mulatto woman, apparently the
waiter's wife, he turned on his spiel. She listened to it
patiently, even speaking some words in praise, as he
explained the narrative in brief, but he failed to make a
sale. He tried more subtle arts, but in vain. And then
she told him frankly that their finances would not permit
her to purchase the volume. This excuse always made
Wyeth desist from further effort.</p>

<p>He turned into the next house, and the next, and the
next, until a half dozen had been made, but with the same
result. Since he had invariably sold to three-fourths of
the people whom he approached, he was not nearly so
confident by this time. These people lived in and owned
homes that were a pride, and it was not that they did
not wish to buy; people so easily approached can be
expected, in a large part, to fall victim; but 'ere long it
became more clear to him. They were <i>not</i> able. It was
well that he perceived this; for hope of success was
small, if it depended upon purchasers here. Most of the
people he found in these homes were dependent upon a
very small salary. The cost of living was as high here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
as in the north, in fact, the ordinary commodities were
higher. The sums they were receiving would not be
considered sufficient to care for the same people in the
north, therefore, why should it here? This was contrary
again to what Sidney had always been told.</p>

<p>Presently, he happened upon a letter carrier. No time
was lost here. This man was paid for his work, so he
forthwith became a victim of the most artful spiel, and
bought the book, cash. This served to spur Sidney to
renew his efforts, and he attacked those he approached
more vigorously. For a time he met with no more success.</p>

<p>He had a lunch at a nearby restaurant, of pigs feet and
sweet potato custard. After an hour, he resumed his
efforts. And this began his discoveries.</p>

<p>Entering a yard, he came up the steps of a house from
the back way. He passed a refrigerator, and crossed the
porch to knock at the door. But&mdash;a bottle of Kentucky's
John Barleycorn calmly rested upon this same refrigerator.</p>

<p>The door at which he knocked was opened presently,
and he was invited to enter, which he did; but, when
leaving by the same way, after selling another book for
cash, "John" was gone.</p>

<p>At the next house, his customer was a tall woman of
middle age and dark skinned. She drew him adroitly
into a prolonged conversation, and then bought the book.</p>

<p>Now, Attalia is a <i>prohibition</i> town in a southern
<i>prohibition</i> state. Yes, it <i>is</i>&mdash;and it <i>isn't</i>. When Sidney
Wyeth left that house that afternoon, he had spent part
of what he received for the book, for beer and whiskey.
Moreover, he was told that more than seventy-five places
on Audubon Avenue were engaged likewise, and in the
city all&mdash;but that is a matter for conjecture!</p>

<p>Obviously, <i>prohibition</i> did not <i>prohibit</i>&mdash;but more of
this later in the story.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That evening, while dining, he became acquainted with
Ferguson and Thurman, who will, for a time, occupy a
part in the development of this plot.</p>

<p>Ferguson was a preacher, but at this time&mdash;and for
some time&mdash;had not preached. He admitted painting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
be more profitable from a financial point of view. He
complained, however, that if the "New Freedom" continued
in power much longer at Washington, and with
the way things "was a-goin'," he would have to give that
up and go back to pickin' cotton.</p>

<p>"They ain' nothin' in preachin' no mo', that's a sho
thing."</p>

<p>"I do not agree with you on that score," said Sidney;
"for, from what I have learned already in regard to these
parts, there must apparently be more money in preaching
than anything else, judging from the number of preachers.
And how fat they all appear!" Ferguson looked up
quickly at this remark, and as quickly down at himself.</p>

<p>"I didn' get this flesh preachin', I assuah you," he
retorted, with flushed face. And after a pause, he went
on with some heat:</p>

<p>"But that's what don' sp'iled preachin'; too many
lazy nigga's a-graftin offa de people!" But Ferguson, as
Wyeth learned later, was something of a pessimist, and
predicted all kinds of deplorable things. And it was at
this moment that a dejected creature made his appearance.
He was bald headed, bowlegged, but, notwithstanding
these possible deficiencies in his make-up, aggressive.
His name was Thurman, and, said he, between bites of
sweet potato pie:</p>

<p>"Aw, nigga;&mdash;youah allus a-p'dictin'&mdash;som'thin' awful!&mdash;To&mdash;heah
you tell it,&mdash;since the democrats&mdash;has got
int' powah&mdash;cawse a buncha crazy nigga's&mdash;didn' know
how t' vote&mdash;at dat aih convention in Chicawgo&mdash;the
world is&mdash;liable to end tomorra'!"</p>

<p>"It mought!&mdash;It mought;&mdash;'n' 'f it did&mdash;you be one&mdash;a
d' fust&mdash;t' bu'n in hell&mdash;too; but don't you 'dress me
lak dat no mo'&mdash;in sech distressful terms! You autta be
'shamed a-yo' se'f."</p>

<p>And he munched pie for a time, uninterrupted by
speech.</p>

<p>Thurman only grunted unconcernedly.</p>

<p>"What are the prospects of the colored people down
here at the present time?" inquired Sidney, hoping to
relieve the tension; but he could have rested easily on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
this score, for, as he learned later, they carried on that
way every night. That was their diversion; but Thurman
was now heard from.</p>

<p>"HELL!" he answered calmly.</p>

<p>"Good Lawd man!" cried Ferguson shocked. "What's
comin' ovah you!"</p>

<p>"Lyin' 'n' stealin'; drinkin' cawn liquah 'n' gittin'
drunk; bein' run in, locked up and sent to d' stock-ade
'n' chain-gang;" he resumed, ignoring Ferguson's shock
entirely. Whereupon, Ferguson looked more distressed
than ever; but only wrinkled his face in a helpless frown,
and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Gee!" cried Sidney; "but that's an awful prospect."
All this time Thurman had not smiled, but accepted
everything as a matter of course, from the way he partook
of sweet potato pie.</p>

<p>"You must not pay any attention to Mr. Thurman,
Mister," said the proprietress, from across the room.
She was a patient-faced, sleepy, short woman. And now,
for the first time Thurman moved in his seat, and took
exception to the words. Said he, somewhat loudly, and
emphasizing his words with a raised hand:</p>

<p>"<i>Pay no 'tention! Pay no 'tention; wull I reckon yu'd
bettah. Hump</i>," he deliberated, pausing long enough to
fill his mouth with more potato: "<i>Pay no 'tention when
yu' know yu'se'f that Jedge Ly'les 's a sentincin' mo'
nigga's to the stock-ade 'n' chain-gang than he's eve' done
befo'. 'N' a good reason he has fo' doin' so too! Lyin',
doity, stinkin', stealin' nigga's</i>," he ended disgustedly.</p>

<p>Presently, before anyone had time to deny his sweeping
assertion, he resumed:</p>

<p>"Mis' M'coy, yu' know dem taters I got frum you
tuther night?"</p>

<p>"I rember them quite well, Mr. Thurman," she replied,
resignedly.</p>

<p>"I took them taters home 'n' put 'm in muh trunk,
locked it 'n' put th' key in muh pocket 's I allus do.
Now what yu' think happened?" he halted, and surveyed
the atmosphere with serene contempt. "That low
down li'l' nigga in th' room wi' me, sneaks int' that trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
wid a duplicate key, 'n' steal eve' last one'm! <i>Jes' think
of it!</i>" he emphasized, with a terrible gesture. "<i>Stole
eve' las' one uv'm! Then talk about nigga's!</i>"</p>

<p>"We did'n' say nothin' 'bout nigga's would'n' steal,
man!" complained Ferguson. "You jes' nache'lly went
offa yo' noodle widout 'casion."</p>

<p>During all this conversation, a girl sat opposite Sidney.
She was a dark, sweet-faced maiden, with an expression
that was inviting. Sidney, happening to glance for the
first time into her face, smiled and nodded. She smiled
back pleasantly. Ferguson and Thurman continued their
harrangue.</p>

<p>"They are a pair," ventured Sidney, to no one in particular,
but the girl smiled and inquired:</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"I never saw them before," he replied.</p>

<p>She observed him closely, and said presently, in a very
demure voice:</p>

<p>"Indeed. Ah&mdash;then&mdash;you don't live here?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, and told her.</p>

<p>"O-oh, my," she echoed tremulously. "It must be
fine away up in the great northwest. And&mdash;do you
expect to be here&mdash;er, some time?"</p>

<p>"For a few months at least." Whereupon she inquired
as to his business, and he likewise inquired of hers.</p>

<p>"I am employed in service," she said.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Sidney had, a few months
before, met an agent in Dayton, who persisted in canvassing
nowhere else but among this class. He thought
of this, and made inquiry. He was told in reply, that
practically all the domestics were colored.</p>

<p>"I would like to see the book you sell," she said,
presently. "If you could bring it to the number where
I am employed, and if, after seeing it I am pleased with
it, I would buy one." He could not have wished for anything
better, and told her so. Elevating his eye brows
in pleased delight, he said:</p>

<p>"I most assuredly will. Only tell me how I may get
there&mdash;I'll make a note of it," and he immediately did so.</p>

<p>"Catch a Plum Street car," she directed, "and get off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
at West Eleventh Street, walk a block and a half west
until you see a large house numbered 40. They are Jews,
so, should you lose the number, inquire for Hershes'.
You may call any time after two P.M."</p>

<p>"I will be there tomorrow at that hour if the sun rises,
and if it doesn't, I'll be there anyway," he laughed.
She was amused.</p>

<p>"All right," she said, and took her leave.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The next day was beautiful; the sun shone brightly,
and the air was soft and fragrant. Plum Street, besides
being the leading business thoroughfare, is likewise the
most imposing resident district, at its extreme end.
Large cars, modern and built of steel, thread their
way, not only to the city limits, but they penetrate far
into the country beyond.</p>

<p>And it was aboard one of these modern conveyances
that Sidney Wyeth reclined, observing the size and
grandeur of the many magnificent residences, that stood
back from either side of the street in sumptuous splendor.
Magnolias and an occasional palm adorned the yards,
while green grass and winter flowers filled the balmy air
with a delightful odor.</p>

<p>He alighted and found himself very soon in the rear of
No. 40. Success was his, for he sold to the girl, and three
more at the same number, and the next, and the next&mdash;and
still the next, until darkness came. Thus he came in
touch with people who were more able, and positively,
more likely to buy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A few days after this he dropped in on Tompkins.</p>

<p>"Hello, my friend!" that worthy one said. "Why
haven't you been in to see me? I've been thinking of
you."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Sidney, in glad surprise. "I've been
too busy," he concluded shortly.</p>

<p>"Too busy!" echoed the other in evident surprise.
And then he waited expectantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," Sidney smiled, looking over Tompkins'
supply of books, mostly Bibles, for such was the most
Tompkins sold, as he learned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Been selling lots of books?..."</p>

<p>"Hundred and sixty-five orders in eight days."</p>

<p>"Great goodness," Tompkins exclaimed. He dropped
all work for a moment, and stood with mouth wide open.
Then he inquired artfully: "Have you <i>delivered</i> any?"</p>

<p>"Fifty copies last Saturday and Monday."</p>

<p>"<i>Man!</i> Are you telling me the truth!" he exclaimed
dubiously.</p>

<p>"I <i>sell</i> books," Sidney replied calmly.</p>

<p>Tompkins resumed his work in a very thoughtful mood.
Presently, as Sidney was leaving he called: "Say, drop
in and see me some day when you have time to talk&mdash;a
long talk. I'm <i>interested</i> in you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>And He Never Knew</i></p>


<p>Weeks had passed. Mildred Latham could be seen
sitting dejectedly by the window of her small bed-room,
gazing down a street that led to the river. Every day
since that next day when she had been told that a man
had called to see her, and instinct told her it was Sidney
Wyeth, she had sat thus. On this day, however, things
were different. There had been a change&mdash;a great change
in her life; for she was today, and henceforth, free, in a
sense, but this is further along in the story.</p>

<p>Presently she picked up <i>The Tempest</i>. This was nothing
unusual. Although she had read it in two days after
she had received it, she had, in the weeks that had just
passed, picked it up and reread certain parts of it. But,
as a change had come since the last time she held it, she
read it today with unusual interest. After reading for a
few minutes, she laid it aside, took from the table near
a map of South Dakota, and for a time studied the part
of it across which was written <i>The Rosebud Country</i>.
She allowed her mind to wander meditatively back to the
past. She saw this land as it was when the country was
young; when the bison and the native Indian held sway;
when mighty herds roamed across those plains, molested
little by the red man. She picked up the book and read
a little more. For scores of years they had lived and
died, and at the end of this regime, came the inevitable
white man, the greatest race of conquerors the world has
ever known, without doubt. And behold the change of a
few short years! Nature in wild profusion, then materialism
in the extreme. They, these conquerors, had almost
changed the world. And among those thousands that
crossed the densely settled prairies, and made conquest
of <i>The Rosebud Country</i>, were only a few black men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Judging from this book, they could be counted upon the
fingers of one hand. One of these was Sidney Wyeth.</p>

<p>Yes, he had gone forth, hopeful and happy and gay,
and had become a Negro pioneer. So he began, and did
a man's part in the development of that now wonderful
country. Thus she imagined it, and felt it must have
been. It <i>could</i> not have been otherwise, because only
<i>men</i> went west, to the wild and undeveloped&mdash;and
stayed. <i>He</i> had stayed for ten years. How he spent
those years, Mildred Latham could imagine. Through
the pages of that narrative, she had followed his fortunes
to the climax&mdash;the culmination of a base intrigue. What
a glorious feeling it must be, she felt, to be a pioneer;
to blaze the way for others, that human beings ever
after, to the end of time, may live and thrive by the right
of others' conquest! He had plowed the soil, turned
hundreds of acres of that wild land into a state of plant
productivity, which should bear fruit for posterity. And
if Sidney Wyeth had in the end failed, in a way it was
only after he had done a man's part in behalf of others.</p>

<p>But then came the evil.</p>

<p>In the lives of all men, the greatest thing is to love.
Sidney Wyeth had hoped, at some time, to gain this
happiness, the love of a woman. Had he earned it?
Apparently not, from another's point of view. That was
all so singular, she thought, time and again. For
the evil creature, evil genius, was a preacher, a minister
of the Gospel. "I can't quite reconcile myself to that
part of it, yet I should," she mused, now aloud, "for <i>my</i>
father is a preacher."</p>

<p>Mildred Latham's thoughts drifted from Sidney Wyeth
for a time, and reverted to her own life, and that of her
father, who was a preacher. Soon, they wandered back
to Sidney, to his life of Hell&mdash;the work of an evil power&mdash;the
torn soul upon its rack of torture&mdash;and finally the
anguish&mdash;always the anguish, followed by the dead calm
of endless existence.</p>

<p>Yet during their acquaintance, he never spoke of the
past. No word of censure, or of unmanly criticism,
passed his lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mildred Latham could feel in a measure relieved,
for she had secrets,&mdash;and she kept them all to herself, too.</p>

<p>Directly, she shook off the depression, and rose to her
feet.</p>

<p>"It is all settled," she said half aloud, and, going to
her trunk, laid the book in the tray, lifted the latter out,
and, reaching to the bottom, took up a small steel box
and set it on the dresser. She then inserted a small key,
opened it, and took therefrom a heavy, legal document.
Examining it for a time, she put it into her hand bag,
locked the box, returned it to its place, replaced the tray
and locked the trunk again. This done, she slipped into
a street suit, and, gathering up the handbag firmly, left her
room, locked the door, stepped into the street, and caught
a car that took her up town, where she alighted before a
mammoth office building. She entered this, took an
elevator and got off on the twentieth floor, entering the
office of a prominent law firm. This visit had been pre-arranged.</p>

<p>An hour later, she left a large bank on the ground floor,
returned to her room, took the box from her trunk, and
replaced, not the legal document, but a long, green slip
of paper.</p>

<p>"All is now settled on that score," she whispered
drearily, and then busied herself mechanically about the
room. Again she fell into that fit of meditation. She
could not&mdash;try as she might&mdash;shake off the despondency.
And always, in the background somewhere, lurked Sidney
Wyeth. Was this because she felt she would never see
him again? She couldn't, she knew, as she recalled her
secret.</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw herself weakly across the bed, and
sobbed for hours. "Sidney, my Sidney," a careful
listener might have heard her lips murmur. But she was
alone. Perhaps that made it so hard, for she was alone
now, always alone.</p>

<p>At last she got up and bathed her face, as she had done
many times before.</p>

<p>Always, too, she had a presentiment down in her heart,
that somewhere or somehow, some day fate would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
kind and send him again into her life. And then would
she be ready?</p>

<p>O that persistent question!</p>

<p>Now Mildred Latham was not a weak woman. Far
from it. In spite of the secret, which was ever <i>her burden</i>,
she was not the kind to give up without struggle. This
was perhaps the cause, in a degree, of the suffering she
endured. It was this sorrow which Sidney Wyeth had
observed, and wished to dispell. "If I could only have
permitted him to do so," she said, so many, many times.
But always <i>The Barrier</i>.</p>

<p>"I will sell his book henceforth for my living," she
said to herself at the end of that day, as she had often
said before. "And in doing that, I shall ever live with
his memory&mdash;God bless him!" For Mildred Latham
loved Sidney Wyeth.</p>

<p>And he never knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>B.J. Dickson</i></p>


<p>When Sidney Wyeth's work among the domestics was
an assured success, he decided to rent desk space in the
large office building referred to, get a typewriter, do a
little circularizing, and concentrate his efforts upon securing
agents elsewhere, for the purpose of distributing his
work.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one Sunday morning, after being told
that the custodian of the building could be found in his
office on the fourth floor, he betook himself thither.</p>

<p>But let us pause for a moment, and retrace a long span
of years, that we may interest ourselves in the history of
this same structure. For it has a fascinating tale to tell.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Before freedom came to the black people of the south,
pious worship had begun. Despite the fact that it was
an offense to teach Negroes during that dark period, or
in any way to be responsible for allowing them to teach
themselves, many, nevertheless, did learn to read; and
perhaps because the slave-owners were inclined to be
God-fearing people, they did not, in a general sense,
openly object when they found many of their slaves worshipping.
So it happened that, since men were in the
majority of those who learned to read, the first channel
to which they diverted this knowledge was preaching.
And since, as above mentioned, they were not always
forbidden, worshipping the Christ among Negroes had
been practiced long before freedom came. Therefore,
after freedom, preaching became the leading profession
among the men.</p>

<p>The reader is perhaps well acquainted with the pious
emotion of the Negro; our story will not dwell at length
upon this; but the fact that, to become a preacher as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
professional pursuit, was the easiest and most popular
vocation; and from the fact, further, that Negroes had
become emotionally inclined from fear in one sense and
another, so that it is inherent, preaching and building
churches swept that part of the country like wildfire.</p>

<p>Of the different sects, the Baptist seemed to require
the least training in order to afford the most emotion.
All that was required, in a measure, to become a Baptist
preacher, was to be a good "<i>feeler</i>" and the practiced
ability to make others <i>feel</i>.</p>

<p>History proves that people of all races (when still not
far removed from savagery) are inclined toward display.
This is an inherent nature of Negroes. Indeed, Negroes
of today, in many instances those who have graduated
from the best colleges, seem yet largely endowed with this
trait, as this story will show later.</p>

<p>So, shortly after preaching and shouting became the
custom, another feature entered which permitted these
people more "<i>feeling</i>," and this was lodges, secret societies
and social fraternities. These, like everything else&mdash;omitting
possibly the extreme "<i>feeling</i>" exercised during
religious worship&mdash;was patterned after white custom;
but, insofar as the Negro is concerned, a great deal more
stress and effort and feeling was put into the things
mentioned. In a sense, they were the Negroes all.</p>

<p>Naturally, these many lodges, etc., must have some
object. And that object for years, was irrevocably, to
care for the sick and bury the dead.</p>

<p>Our story will be concerned with the United Order of
the AAASSSSBBBBGG, which, for the purpose of this
story, will answer as well as the real name, and will be
much easier to refer to.</p>

<p>The AAASSSSBBBBGG, is one of the oldest lodges in
Dixie, having been in operation among the black people
for generations. And its great object was, until a few
years ago, to "ce'h fo' the sick 'n' bu'y the dead."</p>

<p>In the course of events, there had been elected to a
very conspicuous position in this same lodge, a man with
a square jaw. He was of medium height and build, but
aggressive, very much so, in fact, a born fighter. Hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>pily,
the latter trait was peculiarly necessary to the one
who held the office of grand secretaryship in this lodge&mdash;and
to this office Dickson fell heir.</p>

<p>Now Dickson was no ordinary Negro. He was ambitious,
not the kind that is likely to be satisfied with
the past duties of the order. Because, and it might be
well to mention so strange a coincidence: This lodge had
not been able to spend all the money that had come into
the treasury for burial purposes. So the reserve totalled
$40,000 cash. It was confidentially whispered that the
officers, a united click, preceding Dickson, had calmly
planned, when this amount reached $50,000, to grab it
all, and start a colony&mdash;for themselves, of course, in
Africa. But, alas! enters Dickson, the determined, the
ambitious. And if anything can serve to disturb an
order like this, it is ambition. In all the years of its
existence, the slogan had been to crucify ambition religiously,
but Dickson crucified them. At this time, at
least, they were relegated to the scrub timber, where they
lay dreaming of a time never to return, for "the old order
changeth."</p>

<p>In addition to the office of grand secretary, Dickson
was an editor, and before the moss-backs had realized it,
some years before, he was editing the official mouthpiece,
<i>The Independent</i>. They thought little of this, in fact, they
didn't care, because, in the first place, no one else cared
for that job; it required too much thought to edit a
paper that the members would be likely to read. <i>The
Independent</i> had come out at spasmodic intervals, reporting,
in detail, the death of Miss Sallie Doe, "a member
in good standing, who had met her Jesus on the altar of
evermore;" or, that Jim Johnson, another member, "had
been incarcerated in the county jail, along with many
others, for disturbing the peace;" or, that at the revival
at the Antioch Baptist church, of which Brother Jasper
was the pastor, "a soul stirring revival is going on with
scores 'gittin' right with Jesus'," etc., etc., etc. But its
greatest ambition, apparently, had been to come before
the people, guaranteed not to be read.</p>

<p>So fancy, when, after getting control, Dickson "did it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
all over." <i>The Independent</i> became "<i>some</i>" paper. It
fairly ripped and snorted. It took up the instances of
officers that were sluggish and backward and slow, and
made great headlines. "Whew!" the members cried,
who had never read the paper before. While others
declared: "Ah allus knowed dat nigga's crazy!" But
everybody began reading the paper. They objected and
scrambled and stewed about what was said, called him
the biggest liar, bull-dozer, and everything else, but read
the paper. So the circulation doubled and trebled and
quadrupled, and then doubled all over again, until it
was reaching every "live" member of the order. Dickson
didn't care whether it reached the others or not, and he
told them so; moreover, he said&mdash;in not so many words,
but it was read between the lines,&mdash;that they could go to
Hell. They took the paper then.</p>

<p>There came a time at last when the treasury was
reeking with Sam's good gold, and Dickson had more
enemies than could be counted readily. But Dickson
was wise. He had looked deeply into the condition and
inborn weakness of these black creatures, and had surmised
that they only patronized each other when they
mutually hated. If they loved one another, they were
allowed to starve to death undisturbed.</p>

<p>He saw that Negroes would only build and occupy an
office when the white man refused to rent him anything
but the attic&mdash;and not even that sometimes. So, with a
flare, a blaze and a roar, out came <i>The Independent</i>, and
said that the AAASSSSBBBBGG lodge had decided to
erect an office building of its own. It was to be six stories
in height, of brick, with stone cornices, and what not.
Moreover, a picture of it completed appeared on the
front page of <i>The Independent</i>. That finished it! They
prepared to send him to the mad-house, and forthwith
gathered for that purpose, which was what Dickson
wanted. They arrived in twos, threes and fours, and then
in droves. To the tune and number of thousands they
came and were met (?) by a brass band! And away went
the music: "Ta-ra&mdash;ta&mdash;ta-ti-rip-i-ta-ta-ta-tu!" It got
into the Negro blood. Music, of all things, always has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
effect. Before they were aware of it, they were cake-walkin'
and doin' the grizzly bear, and it has also been
whispered confidentially, that two preachers, high and
mighty in the order, "balled the jack." The music
stopped for a spell. Through the crowd&mdash;the black
crowd&mdash;came a cry, "Arrah! Arrah! for the Negro, the
greatest race since the coming of Christ!" And it was
answered: "Arrah! Arrah! So we is. Who said we
wasn't!" "The white man!" came back the reply.
"He's a liah!" went back the words heatedly. "If so,
then," came back, "why do we continue to do our business
in his attic? Why?" This was a shock. But before
recovery, sayeth the cry: "$50,000 odd we have in the
treasury to care for the sick and bury the dead! With
$60,000 more we can have a building all our own, with
elevators and mirrors and a thousand things, with our
own girls to tickle the type and scratch on the books."
A wild dream flitted across the minds of these black men,
the underdogs, the slaves for a thousand years; their
wives, the cooks and the scrub women; their daughters,
the lust of the beast. And then from somewhere came
another cry. It was soft and low, but firm and regular.
It came from a body of women, black women. "With
our hands, from the white people's pot, we will give unto
thee thousands, and back again to the pots we will go
and slave, until our old bones can slave no more, and
pay, and pay until a mighty building, the picture of
which we have seen, shall stand as a monument to the
effort of BLACK PEOPLE!"</p>

<p>And now there was a scramble to the front! It was a
scramble as had never been seen in Attalia before!
$60,000 was fairly thrown over the heads of one another
to B.J. DICKSON, the grand secretary.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Six months and a year had elapsed. And the monument
stood serenely in the sunlight, as Sidney Wyeth
came down the street that Sunday morn. To the side of
this monument stood another, imposing and grand, not
yet finished, but soon to be, and it had all come through
the indirect efforts of B.J. Dickson. They were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
satisfied with the one, when they learned they <i>could</i> do
things, but needed another&mdash;so they subscribed the
necessary funds without effort, and built the other.</p>

<p>Before entering, Sidney walked across the street and
viewed the structure from the other side.</p>

<p>Thus he saw his people, as others see them.</p>

<p>For his life had been spent, for the most part, in
white civilization.</p>

<p>As he surveyed it carefully, he was relieved to find
that, to a stranger, there was nothing to indicate that
colored people occupied the building.</p>

<p>An intelligent looking man came out of it, and, crossing
the street, bowed casually to Wyeth. The latter, returning
it, inquired regarding the building and Dickson, and
he was told the following:</p>

<p>"Yes, while there are many who do not give Dickson
the credit, he is, nevertheless, the man who has made all
that possible."</p>

<p>"Everything is well kept apparently," said Wyeth.
"That is unusual for our people."</p>

<p>"That's Dickson," said the other. And then aside he
inquired:</p>

<p>"Have you ever been through it?"</p>

<p>"I am just going," said Sidney.</p>

<p>"You should have done so during the week. Any
time before one o'clock Saturday."</p>

<p>"Why one o'clock Saturday?"</p>

<p>"Because everything ceases at that time."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Wyeth commented in wide surprise.
"System?"</p>

<p>"That's it. That's Dickson."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Does he have charge of everything?"</p>

<p>"Indirectly, yes. That is, he does not own everything,
of course not; but it's like this: Do you observe how
everything is in order?" Wyeth did, and waited.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the stranger: "You can bet your
boots that it would not be that way, if it were left to
those in the buildings altogether. No; they would&mdash;some
of them&mdash;get into a fight, knock out a window or two,
and bring a pillow from home, to stick in the hole. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
first time it rained and blew in at the window, the plaster
would fall. Then, others, posing more than anything
else, would have a crap game going on and sell whiskey
on the side. As for the letters in gold which you observe
on the windows, they are Dickson's ideas. Negroes
would use chalk naturally. But Dickson won't stand
for anything like that. When anything is amiss, he goes
at them, as for instance, those stores in the front. Many
of the proprietors, when they empty a box, instead of
putting it to the rear, would stick it in the front, right up
where every passerby could see it. To augment it further,
they would allow dust and dead flies to collect. Cobwebs
too and perhaps, pile a few old rags up on the top of it.
But B.J. goes to them, as I said, invites them across the
street, and shows it to them. He takes them up to one
end of the building, and walks them to the other, and
allows them to see it as the casual observer would. If
he doesn't think or consider this sufficient, he takes them
up town, and allows their gaze to compare it with the
way things are conducted by the first class white people.
And then he says: 'Now just look at it! That's nigga's.
Nigga's proper. You conduct your place so that every
stranger, seeing the city and the sights, when he gets
before this building, realizes at one glance that Negroes
occupy it.'"</p>

<p>Sidney laughed a low, amused laugh. The other continued:</p>

<p>"That's why you see things as they are. Our people
are not bad to handle. They are, in fact, the most
patriotic of all races, and are surely anxious for the
success of each other, only they don't know it. They are
like a herd without a leader. Dickson's a leader over
there."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Sidney, "that's where it comes in.
The race needs leaders!" Again the other was speaking.</p>

<p>"Of course, we have a great many that would be
leaders, oh, yes, indeed! Over there in that building are
many who are pining their lives away. They are confident
they are leaders, and are exasperated because they have
no following. They hate the people because they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
awake to the fact. They declare, that they have <i>even
been to school and graduated from college and know everything</i>,
which <i>alone</i> should put them at the head. For
some peculiar reason, they cannot realize that leaders
are born, not made.</p>

<p>"Now you leave the building and wander about over
the city, and you will find a score or more of these would-be
leaders, all with the same delusion in regard to themselves.
They include, for the most part, teachers,
preachers and doctors. They are so wrapped up in this
idea, that they are utterly incapable of appreciating what
the race is actually doing, and trying to do. Of these,
perhaps the worst are the teachers. This is probably
because they are paid by the county, and do not have to
cater to the masses for their support." He paused, and
extended his hand. "Glad to know you, stranger, and
good-by."</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth watched him disappear, and then
crossed the street to the building, and entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Oh, You Sell Books</i>"</p>


<p>One beautiful day, the <i>Palm Leaf Limited</i> carried
another passenger southward, aboard the Jim Crow car.
It was Mildred Latham, and her destination required a
change at Chattanooga. Turning her course, however,
she went west and alighted at a town, happily located
upon the banks of the Mississippi. It was a large metropolis,
a fac-simile of a sister city, Attalia.</p>

<p>Miss Latham left the depot at once, and proceeded to
Beal Street, which was entirely occupied by Negroes.
She entered a restaurant, but soon came out, and started
in search of a room. However, the land-ladies all told
her they preferred men, so she decided to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>A car put her off at a corner far removed from Beal
Street. She passed down a clean, quiet street, lined on
either side by comfortable homes occupied by colored
people. She paused before a small but handsome stone
church. It was the First Presbyterian, so the cornerstone
read. To the side, and back from the sidewalk,
completely surrounded by vines, was the parsonage, at
least she took it for such. And so it proved to be. She
hesitated a moment, then, with an air of finality, she
opened the gate, entered the yard, and mounted the steps.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a kindly lady, whom she
judged to be the pastor's wife.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, please," began Miss Latham demurely,
"but I am a stranger, recently arrived in the city, and
have been unable to secure lodging. I noted the church
next door, and surmised that, if this is the parsonage,
and if the pastor is in, he might assist me." She hesitated,
and for a time seemed at a loss how to proceed. In the
meantime, the other surveyed her critically. Strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
women were always regarded with suspicion. Finally
she replied kindly, swinging the door wide:</p>

<p>"Come in, my dear child. You look tired and surely
need rest. You must have come a long way. The pastor
of the church you refer to is not in for the present, and,
I regret to say, is out of the city, and is not expected
back for several days. I am his sister, however, and will
help you all I can." She paused as she placed a rocker
at the disposal of the stranger, and relieved her of coat
and hat.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Mildred gratefully. "I
hardly know how to thank you."</p>

<p>"Please do not speak of it, my dear. As I am alone,
you may stay with me until you have found the kind of
place you desire." She was silent and thoughtful for a
moment, and then asked softly, "where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"I do declare!" exclaimed the other in mild surprise.
"I have relatives there; but I have never seen the city
myself."</p>

<p>The stranger appeared relieved.</p>

<p>"And do you expect to be in the city long?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. I am here to sell a book, <i>The Tempest</i>,
a western story, by a Negro author. And, of course, it
depends upon that, as to how long I shall stay."</p>

<p>"Oh, you sell books." Mildred did not correct her.
"I used to sell books, and, indeed I liked it. I am fond
of reading. I am anxious to see the book you speak of
when it is convenient, since I have observed advertisements
of it."</p>

<p>"It is a nice book," Mildred commented. "And as
soon as I can have access to my trunk at the depot, I
shall be delighted to let you see and read it."</p>

<p>"I shall indeed be pleased, I assure you," the other
smiled back sweetly. "I am always so interested when
it comes to books, that I wish, when you have had something
to eat, you would tell me the story of <i>The Tempest</i>."</p>

<p>"It will be a pleasure; but you need not fix me lunch,
for I just ate a short time ago, as I came from the station.
So, if you now wish, I will tell, in as few words as possible,
and as best I can, the story of this book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"The story opens up on the banks of the river, near
this city.... It concerns a young man, restless and discontented,
who regarded the world as a great opportunity.
So he set forth to seek his fortune.... Thus it began, but
shortly, it led through a maze of adventures, to a land in
the west. It is, perhaps, the land of the future; a land
in which opportunity awaits for courageous youths,
strong men, and good women.... This land is called
<i>The Rosebud Indian Reservation</i>. It lays in southern
South Dakota, and slopes back from the banks of the
'Big Muddy', stretching for many miles into the interior
beyond. It is a prairie country. No trees, stumps,
rocks or stones mar the progress of civilization. So the
white men and only a few blacks unloaded at a town on
or near the frontier. I think it is called Bonesteel. And
then the mighty herd of human beings flocked and settled
over all that broad expanse, claiming it by the right of
conquest.</p>

<p>"Among these many, conspicuous at the front, was the
hero of this narrative. He came into a share, a creditable
share, and, although far removed from the haunts of his
own, and surrounded on all sides by a white race, he was
duly inoculated with that spirit which makes men successful.</p>

<p>"Time went on, and in a few years there was no more
reservation, but it became <i>The Rosebud Country</i>, the land
of the optimist.</p>

<p>"Then, of course, came to him that longing, that
dream, the greatest of all desires, the love of a woman.
But of his own race there were none, and he did not feel
it right to wed a white wife. But at last, he found one
of his own blood. She was kind, good and refined, but
in conviction she was weak, without strength of her own.
She loved him&mdash;as such women love, but to her father,
a preacher, she was obedient,&mdash;subservient. They lived
for some months in happiness, until that other&mdash;her
father&mdash;came to visit them. These two, her father and
her husband, differed, both in thought and action, and,
naturally out of sympathy. In short, they disagreed
upon all points, including the daughter, the wife, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
last the mother, for in time such she became. And that,
strange to say, instead of being the birth of a new freedom,
was the end of all things.</p>

<p>"So o'er this land of the free there came a change, a
sad change, that led to the end, the end of <i>The Tempest</i>."
She paused, and allowed her eyes to remain upon the rug
before her, while the other listened for more. Presently
she said:</p>

<p>"And was it her father&mdash;who stooped to <i>this</i>?"</p>

<p>The other nodded and remained silent, with downcast
eyes.</p>

<p>Mildred Latham could not have said more had she
wished&mdash;just then. A peculiar feeling came over her,
and her mind went back to a night not long before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Office of the Grand Secretary</i></p>


<p>When Sidney Wyeth walked into the office of B.J.
Dickson that Sunday morning, he found him alone,
engaged in reading. When a step sounded at the door,
he laid the paper aside and glanced searchingly at the
intruder. Wyeth saw before him, the man of determination:
the square jaw, the determined set of the neck;
otherwise he would not attract any particular attention
in a crowd. But this was B.J. Dickson, of whom he had
heard much since coming to Attalia, and even before.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dickson?" he inquired, respectfully. The other
nodded, and pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>"You have charge of the renting here, so I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to get desk space for the present, and later
on perhaps I might require an office."</p>

<p>"I see," mused the other, surveying him meditatively.
"Well, we have nothing left in this building; but I think
there are two or three rooms not yet rented in the building
you have observed in course of construction. What
kind of business are you engaged in?"</p>

<p>"Books," replied Sidney, simply.</p>

<p>"M-m. Well, I can't give you any information as to
desk space. You can, however, see Morton tomorrow.
His office is on the second floor, the board of trade. He
can enlighten you on that score."</p>

<p>"What do you receive for the rooms?"</p>

<p>"$12.50 a month."</p>

<p>"That is quite reasonable," said Wyeth. The other
looked up with a pleased expression.</p>

<p>"You're one of the few who have made such a remark,"
he commented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! That would be considered cheap in my
section of the country," said Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>Wyeth told him.</p>

<p>"Oh well, you come from a place where the people are
accustomed to something. These down here have been
used to nothing but an attic or an old frame shack, a fireplace
with wind blowing in at the cracks, and, of course,
cannot appreciate steam heat, electric lights, first class
janitor service, and other modern conveniences that go
with such a building."</p>

<p>At this point, several men entered the room, most of
whom were distinguished looking, compared with the
average Negro. Wyeth was introduced to them, and
learned that two were physicians, one a dentist, another
a lawyer, and still another was a letter carrier. The
stranger was soon the object of their many questions.
They were answered deliberately, for Sidney Wyeth was
well informed.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the colored people in the south,
now that you see them yourself?" he was asked. He
noted the pride and air of dignity along with the question.</p>

<p>"I am considerably impressed with what I have seen,
I am sure," Wyeth began cautiously. "It is unnecessary
to say that this is probably the most commodious
structure owned and occupied by our people, in any
city. And, I have noted with a great deal of pride that
you have in the building, also, some half a dozen large
insurance companies, owned and conducted successfully
by members of this race. All of this and other creditable
things, too numerous to mention, count for much in the
solution of the race problem. Much more could be said
in praise, but I do not consider it necessary. And still,
with so much to their credit, there is much also to their
discredit&mdash;very much. I refer to this, since it is a thing
that can be remedied, and positively should be. To
begin with, the people as a whole, do not read nearly as
much as in the north, and are poorly informed in matters
of grave concern and of general interest." He paused,
and saw that they were puzzled. They were, all of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
taken aback. They looked at each other, and then began
to gather color and heat as well.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth had stirred, by his last words, his criticism,
the hornet's nest.</p>

<p>"And what, may I ask," inquired one of the physicians
icily, "has given you that impression?"</p>

<p>"Well, many things," Sidney resumed calmly. "For
instance: I am in the habit of buying <i>The Climax</i>, which
is, as you know, published in New York, and edited by a
man who used to be professor of sociology in one of your
colleges. Now, in all the places I have been" (he didn't
refer to the north, realizing that it would cause more
argument not bearing on the discussion), "I have found
this magazine much in circulation among our people;
but here, at only one place have I found it. You appreciate
that the Negro population of this town is to
exceed, without doubt, sixty thousand. It receives but
fifty copies a month, and does not sell all of <i>them</i>&mdash;of
course there are annual subscribers; but, so there are
everywhere else as well."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;" all began with upraised hand, but Sidney
stopped them with:</p>

<p>"I've made this remark, so hear me out, that I may
show that I am justified in making it."</p>

<p>They were quiet, but impatient.</p>

<p>"You have several large drug stores, doing a creditable
business in the city. Omitting a few operated by white
men in Negro neighborhoods, you will hardly find one
that does not carry a goodly stock of magazines for his
trade. Not a colored drug store carries one. Tompkins,
other than <i>The Climax</i>, does not sell any. Now, gentlemen,
with such a population as you have," (he was very
serious now), "is it consistent to believe that these black
people read in proportion to what they should, when
there is so little current demand for literature?"</p>

<p>The outburst that followed this was too intense to
describe. The composure that was in keeping with their
appearance and training was, for the time, lost. Everybody
had something to say to the contrary, and, at the
same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have five hundred dollars worth of books in my
house," cried Dickson.</p>

<p>"I take <i>The Climax</i>, and have since it began publication,"
cried still another.</p>

<p>"Derwin, its editor, is a traitor to his race, and I can
prove it," persisted another.</p>

<p>"Theah ain' nothin' in it, nohow," yelled another
whose English was not the best.</p>

<p>"It's the only magazine edited by, and in the interest
of this race," retorted Wyeth; "and has a circulation
more than double that of any other publication by
Negroes since freedom."</p>

<p>"You northern Negroes think a whole lot of Derwin,
and are imbued with his point of view," cried Dickson;
"but we had him down here before he went north, and
we know him for what he is," and he looked about him
meaningly.</p>

<p>The others gave sanction.</p>

<p>"He's the author of the only book in sociology, that
stands out as a mark of Negro literature. The book is
a classic, and is one of possibly two or three from the pen
of a Negro since Dumas."</p>

<p>It is difficult to foretell where the argument may have
ended, but Sidney slipped out. As the door closed behind
him, a mighty roar of indignation came over the transom.
"He's a liar." "He's crazy!" "Like all from that
section!"</p>

<p>When these men met Wyeth afterward, and for some
time, they did not recognize him. He was not surprised.
They are, and the best of them, in a measure, still incapable
of accepting criticism as it is meant. Our story
will go to prove this more conclusively later on; but for
the present, Sidney Wyeth had made friends....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Henry Hugh Hodder</i></p>


<p>Weeks had passed, and a touch of spring time was in
the Dixie air. Sidney Wyeth's canvass was now assisted
by another, while from over the country he had secured,
here and there, an agent to sell the book. He found desk
space in an office on the second floor, hired a stenographer,
and filled the country with circular letters.
Perhaps fifty or more replies were received, a few with a
money order and requests for further information.</p>

<p>Although most of the letters were sent to preachers
and teachers throughout the south, two-thirds of the
replies came from the north. From Boston, New York,
Chicago, and centers where literature is obtainable from
the libraries which are open to Negroes, more letters by
far came, than from the south where such is not always
available. And out of these, a few agents were secured.
But it seemed almost an impossibility to interest those at
the south in a subject of literature.</p>

<p>One day, there came a letter from a small town in
Florida that amused Wyeth. It was from the secretary
of the board of trade. In reply to the circular inquiry,
requesting the names of the Negro preachers in that city,
it ran thus:</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Replying to your favor of recent date relative to
the names of Negro preachers of this city. In regard to this, I am
compelled to say, that I cannot fully enlighten you, for this reason:
Everything with trousers appears to be a preacher, or, any one
who can spell "ligon."</p>

<p>My gardener is a preacher, although he finds my work more
remunerative, apparently; but you could, however, write to him,
and he would, I feel sure, give you the desired information.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Sidney appraised Tompkins of his failure to get
the cooperation of southern preachers, in his exploit, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was advised that the preachers were working that "side
of the street."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We cannot appreciatively continue this story, without
including a character that is very conspicuous in Negro
enterprise. That is the undertaker. He is always in
evidence. Mortality among Negroes exceeds, by far,
that among whites. This is due to conditions that we
will not dwell upon, since they will develop during the
course of the story; but in Attalia, there was one undertaker
who was particularly successful. He had the reputation
of burying more Negroes than any man in the
world. He had a son, a ne'er-do-well, to say the least,
and they called him "Spoon."</p>

<p>Sidney, who at this time shared a room with Thurman,
became acquainted with "Spoon" one Sunday night. It
was at a "tiger," of which, as we now know, there were
plenty.</p>

<p>Spoon had a reputation in local colored circles, as well
as his father; but Spoon's reputation was not enviable.
He was booziogically inclined, and reputed by those who
knew him, to be able to consume more liquor than any
other ordinary society man. Moreover, Spoon was
"some" sport, too; could play the piano, in ragtime
tune, and could also "ball the jack." He would lean
back upon the stool, play the latest rag, as no other could,
and at the end, cry: "Give me some more of that 'Sparrow
Gin!'"</p>

<p>Wyeth and Spoon became close friends following their
first meeting, and Sunday nights, they would roam until
one or two in the morning. Spoon knew where every
"tiger" in town was; and, moreover, he proved it.</p>

<p>Thurman, although two and fifty, was no "poke;"
but was a sport too. His began early Sunday morning.
One Sunday morn, as they lay abed, after the light of
the world had come back and claimed its own, Thurman
called to Sidney where the other lay reposing in the
pages of a "best seller." "Say, kid! how 'bout a little
toddy this mawnin'?"</p>

<p>"I'm there," came the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Thurman. "Guess, tho' I'll haf
to go after it, 's see you lost in a book all time. Gee!
Looks lak you'd lose your mind a-readin' so much."
No comment. "Guess that's why you got all these
nigga's a-argun' 'roun' heah though; cause you read and
they don't. M-m; yeh, yeh; that makes a diff'nce.
M-m."</p>

<p>"Wull, reckon' ah'll haf t' git in muh breeches and
crawl ou' and git dat stuff t' make it wid. M-m. Old
Mis' 'roun' the conah 'll be glad t' git dis twenty cents
dis mawnin'. M-m. Wull, kid, be back t'rectly."</p>

<p>He was, sooner than expected. He didn't get outside.
He peeped out. What met his gaze would send any
southern rheumatic Negro back.</p>

<p>It was snow.</p>

<p>"Jesus Chr-i-s-t!" he exclaimed, returning hastily from
the hallway. "Hell has sho turned on dis' mawnin out
dare. K-whew! 'f the's anything in this world I hates,
it's snow."</p>

<p>Sidney stopped reading long enough for a good laugh,
as Thurman skinned off his trousers and clambered back
into bed.</p>

<p>"Aw, shucks, Thur, this is a morning for toddies."</p>

<p>"A mawnin' fo' Hell, yes, hu! hu! Wow!"</p>

<p>After a spell, he peeped from beneath the coverlets.
"Say! since ah come t' think uv't, we c'n have them
toddies wid-out get'n froze out in doin' it."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"I'll get dat liquah from John."</p>

<p>"And who is John?"</p>

<p>"John? Wull, did'n' you git 'quainted wi'im when I
brung you heah? John's the man we room with. He
sells liquah."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Say Spoon," said Sidney one day, "I'm going to cut
the tiger kitin' out."</p>

<p>"Aw, gwan, kid, what you talkin' 'bout?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to church in the mornings, and in the
evenings, I hope to find a place that will be more in
keeping with respectable people," announced Sidney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, let's go up here to old lady Macks, and
get some of that 'Sparrow Gin,'" Spoon suggested,
temptingly.</p>

<p>"To prove that I am not likely to keep my resolution."</p>

<p>"You've none to keep as I can particular see. I have
never seen you drink anything stronger than beer when
you've been with me. You seem to go along with me,
to see me and the others act a fool. Sometimes you
impress me as being a strange person.... I wonder.
Now I wonder...."</p>

<p>"Where is a church that would be likely to appeal
to you and myself?"</p>

<p>"Up on Herald Street is one that I think will appeal
to <i>you</i>. You're serious. Me&mdash;I'm quite unfit for any;
but I'll take you up there, and sit through one of Hodder's
sermons if you care to go. My people are members of
that church, and it is a progressive one."</p>

<p>"We will attend services there&mdash;Sunday morning."</p>

<p>Wyeth became a regular visitor.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, the pastor appraised the congregation
of the fact, that on the following Sunday, they
would have with them the Reverend W. Jacobs, the
energetic young man who was doing such great work
for the training of wayward children. And this takes
our story into a matter of grave human interest.</p>

<p>Coincident with better educational facilities, and the
more careful training of the children, time had brought
a change that was slowly but surely being felt by these
black people in the south. It has already been stated,
that the Baptist church required little literary training in
order to preach; but, in this church, it is quite different,
and no man would be tolerated as a minister, who had
not a great amount of theological, as well as literary
training.</p>

<p>Henry Hugh Hodder was a man, not only prepared in
the lines of theology and literature, but was fully supplied
with practical knowledge as well. He had, at the time
Sidney Wyeth became acquainted with him, gathered to
his church, a majority of Attalia's best black people.
His popularity was, moreover, on the increase, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
church was filled regularly with a class of people who
listened, studied and applied to their welfare, what he
said each Sunday in the pulpit.</p>

<p>His church stood on a corner to the edge of the black
belt, and near a fashionable white neighborhood. And it
had, at the time it was constructed, caused considerable
agitation. When Sidney and Spoon came to the door,
prayer was being offered, and when it was over, they
entered, taking seats near the door.</p>

<p>It was a nicely ventilated church, with large colored
windows, arranged to allow air to pass in without coming
directly upon the congregation. At the front, a small
rostrum rose to the level of the rear, and contained, in
addition to the altar, only four chairs. Sidney was told
afterwards, that, due to a practice always followed in
other churches, particularly the Baptist, of allowing
journeymen preachers to put themselves before the congregation
uninvited, Hodder had removed the chairs in
order to discourage such practice.</p>

<p>Apparently he had succeeded, for, on the Sundays that
followed, Sidney saw only those who were invited, facing
the congregation.</p>

<p>Directly over the rostrum hung a small balcony, which
contained the choir and a pipe organ. Following a song,
the pastor came forward. He was a tall man, with width
in proportion, perhaps two hundred and twenty pounds.
Not unlike the average Negro of today, he was brown-skinned.
His hair, a curly mass of blackness, was brushed
back from a high forehead. His voice, as he opened the
sermon, was deep and resonant. And for his text that
day, he took "Does It Pay!"</p>

<p>Not since Sidney Wyeth had attended church and heard
sermons, had he been so stirred by a discourse! Back
into the ancient times; to the history of Judea and Caesar,
he took the listener, and then subtly applied it to the life
of today. Never had he heard one whose eloquence
could so blend with everyday issues, and cause them to
react as moral uplift. For he knew the black Oman's
need. Pen cannot describe its effect upon Sidney Wyeth.
It seemed, as the words of the pastor came to him, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>vealing
a thousand moral truths, which he had felt, but
could not express, that he had come from afar for a great
thing, that sermon. It lifted him out of the chaos of the
present, and brought him to appreciate what life, and the
duty of existence really meant.</p>

<p>Having, in a sense, drifted away from the pious training
he had received as a youth, Sidney Wyeth was suddenly
jerked back to the past, and enjoyed the experience. On
account of his progressive ideas, he had been accused, by
some of his people, since his return to live among them,
of being an unbeliever. He was often told that he was
not a Christian; they meant, of course, that he was not
a member of a church, which, to most colored people, is
equivalent to disbelief. Sidney Wyeth saw the life, the
instance of Christ as a moral lesson.</p>

<p>When the sermon closed, Wyeth had one desire, and
fulfilled it, and that was to shake Henry Hugh Hodder's
hand; moreover, to tell him, in the only way he knew
how, what the sermon had been to him.</p>

<p>He did so, and was received very simply.</p>

<p>As he approached the rostrum, at the foot of which
stood the pastor, shaking hands with many others who
had come forward in the meantime, he was like one
walking on air. He recalled the many sermons preached
to satisfy the emotion of an ignorant mass, and which,
in hundreds of instances, went wide of the mark, causing
a large portion of the congregation to rise in their seats,
and give utterance to emotional discordance, the same
being often forgotten by the morrow.</p>

<p>Hodder was not only as he was just described, but he
proved to Sidney Wyeth to be a practical, informed, and
observing man as well. When he had received the card,
he inquired of the country from whence Sidney came,
and related briefly the notices he had followed, regarding
its opening a few years previous.</p>

<p>At that moment, a large man, almost white&mdash;that is, he
was white, although a colored man&mdash;was introduced to
him as Mr. Herman. He proved to be the proprietor of
the large barber shop on Plum Street, which had caught
Sidney's attention the day he came. After Mr. Herman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
introduction, he met many others prominent in Negro
circles, including the president and cashier of the local
Negro bank. And thus it came that Sidney Wyeth met
these, the new Negro, and the leaders of a new dispensation.</p>

<p>Two hours after the services had closed, he passed a
big church on Audubon Avenue; a church of the "old
style religion" and, which most Negroes still like. It was
then after two o'clock. Morning service was still in
order&mdash;no, the sermon had closed, but collection hadn't.
Out of curiosity, he entered. The pastor had, during this
period, concentrated his arts on the collection table. He
was just relating the instance of people who put their
dollar over one eye, so closely, that it was liable to freeze
to the eye and bring about utter blindness. "So now,"
he roared, brandishing his arms in a rally call, "<i>We jes'
need a few dollahs mo' to make the collection fo'ty-fo'. I'll
put in a quata', who'll do the rest</i>," whereupon the choir
gave forth a mighty tune, that filled the church with a
strain which made some feel like dancing.</p>

<p>The following Tuesday, an editorial appeared in one of
the leading dailies, concerning the sermon and the instance
of Henry Hugh Hodder. It dwelt at some length on
his work for the evolution of his people, and concluded
by praying that (among the black population) great
would be the day when such men and such sermons were
an established order.</p>

<p>Sidney, now in an office to himself, read it to a man
next door. Whereupon the other said:</p>

<p>"Oh, that is nothing unusual. They often speak of
him and his work in the editorial columns. Which might
account for his having such a fine church." ...</p>

<p>Wyeth was silent, apparently at a loss what to say.
The silence had reached a point which was becoming
strained, when another, who happened to be in the office,
relieved it by spitting out sneeringly:</p>

<p>"White fo'kes'll give any nigga plenty money, when
he says what they want him too." He was a deacon in
the big church referred to. This was not investigated.</p>

<p>Wyeth called him a liar then and there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wilson, dear," said Constance Jacobs to her brother,
the pastor, on his return from Attalia, Effingham, and
other places where he was required to go in the interest
of his work. Coming up to him in her usual manner, she
kissed him fondly, for she was not only fond of this, her
only brother, but she was proud of him. Well she could
be, for Wilson Jacobs was a hard, conscientious worker
in the moral uplift of his people. "I have a surprise in
store for you," she said, "and if you are comfortable I
will tell you."</p>

<p>"Little sister," he said, as he kissed her fondly in
return, and gave her his undivided attention.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to tell you, but I have with me,
someone who came during your absence; the most unusual
to be a usual girl I have ever known." She then
related the instance of Mildred Latham's coming, and
the circumstance, including the book. "I have read the
book that she is selling, and with which she seems to be
very successful, in fact, she is so successful that I am
almost persuaded to take up the work myself. The story
is interesting; but it is not that which has caused me
much thought, it is the girl herself.</p>

<p>"She is a beautiful girl, intelligent, kind and winning,
although she does not, as I can see, practice or exercise
any arts to be winning. She is single, and does not
appear to have any interest in the opposite sex, nor does
she appear to care for any society. In fact, besides being
nice and kind to all whom she chances to meet, she does
not have any interest beyond the book. She is simply
foolish about it, just as much so as though the author
were her lover, and depended upon her for its success.</p>

<p>"There is something peculiar, that is, oh, Wilson, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
is something, just something that I cannot understand
about her, that's all." She gave up trying to express
herself for a time, and then he spoke:</p>

<p>"In love, no doubt, and has had trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, then shook her head. "It might be
that; but if it is, it is an extraordinary love affair; but
I am confident it is deeper than that. I catch her at
times looking into space as though her mind were far
away. And at these times, I have taken notice that she
is sad, very sad. My heart goes out to her when I see
her like this, because, for some peculiar reason, I have
fallen in love with her. She found a place to stay, and
was going to move, but I could not think of it. She is
the sweetest companion I ever had.</p>

<p>"I wish you would become interested in her, dear. I
want you to. Perhaps you can get at the bottom of the
mystery that surrounds her. I cannot, and it worries
me, because I want to help her, and it hurts me when
I feel that I cannot. She has become very much interested
in your work, and has been helping me in the
correspondence relative to the same."</p>

<p>"When can I meet this strange person you speak of,
Constance? I am curious, from what you have said.
I gather already that she may be able to help us in some
way in our work."</p>

<p>"She went down the street for a walk, but will return
shortly, since she never goes far." At that moment,
steps sounded on the porch, and a moment later, Mildred
entered quietly, and was on the way to her room, when
Constance met her with: "Oh, Miss Latham. Please
meet my brother who came since you went out. Miss
Latham, my brother, Wilson Jacobs."</p>

<p>"My sister has just been speaking of you, Miss
Latham," said he, after the exchange had been made.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Mildred, smiling pleasantly upon
Constance. "Your sister does me too much honor."</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I am glad to know you, and shall be
pleased to become better acquainted as time goes on.
I am told that you are selling a good book. I have
observed advertisements of the same some time ago, and
will be delighted to read it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred smiled pleasantly, hesitated, and then said:
"Every one I sell to report that they love the book. I
do myself. I think it is such a frank and unbiased story,
and told so simply, that anyone can understand it; yet
with a touching human interest that is, in a measure,
vital to us all. Even persons more highly gifted can
learn something from it, and be entertained as well."</p>

<p>"She has sold over a hundred copies in three weeks,
which I think is extraordinary, don't you?" said Constance
at this point, whereupon Mildred looked slightly
embarrassed. She always did when anyone spoke in
praise of her.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary, excellent, I should say," her brother
smiled. "Where does she find such good customers?"</p>

<p>"I work among the women in domestic service,"
Mildred explained. Wilson looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Indeed! And do you find many readers among them?
You have not been to many of the teachers?"</p>

<p>"I have, yes; but they do not seem to take much
interest in work by Negroes, so far as I have been able
to gather. I could not say for sure, of course not; but
I <i>do</i> find the women in service, in great numbers, to be
fond of reading and full of race pride. Of course, there
are multitudes of ignorant ones who are not capable of
appreciating literature and its value as moral uplift, but,
as a whole, I am highly successful."</p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs was greatly moved by his first conversation
with Mildred, and found himself thinking about her
more than once in the days that followed. His sister
became so deeply interested in her, that after a week had
passed, she had taken up the work also.</p>

<p>"Do you ever play, Miss Latham?" inquired Constance
a few days afterward, and late one afternoon, when they
had returned from their work.</p>

<p>"A little," Mildred admitted. "But it has been so
long since I have touched a key, that I am sure I should
be very awkward if I attempted it. I think you play
nicely."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "I only play when I am quite
sure no one is likely to hear me. There is one piece I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
play, and of which I am very fond. I heard you humming
it the other day. As soon as the parlor is 'comfy,'
I shall ask you to condescend to listen to me play it."</p>

<p>"What piece is that? Please tell me," Mildred inquired.</p>

<p>"Sweet Genevieve."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes...."</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, dearest?" cried Constance,
hurrying toward her.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing!" said the other, hastily mopping
her nose and eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm relieved, but I thought I heard you sob,
but of course you didn't. Of course not. Really, I begin
to feel that if I don't get married soon, I'll become a
nervous, cranky old maid."</p>

<p>"Please don't say such things about yourself," entreated
Mildred. "You were not mistaken. I did&mdash;ah&mdash;I
sobbed&mdash;I mean I coughed. I had something in my
throat," she concluded nervously.</p>

<p>"I'm relieved," smiled the other, and, going to the
piano, she struck the keys, and sang in a high contralto
voice:</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4q">"O, Genevieve, I'd give the world<br /></span>
<span class="i5">To live again the lovely past!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The rose of youth was dew-impearled;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">But now it withers in the blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I see thy face in every dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">My waking thoughts are full of thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy glance is in the starry beam<br /></span>
<span class="i5">That falls along the summer sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was in the small hours of the morning when Mildred
Latham's eyes closed in sleep. All the night through,
the strains of <i>Sweet Genevieve</i> and what it recalled, tortured
her memory, until it was from sheer fatigue that
she did at last fall asleep.</p>

<p>She hoped Constance would play <i>Sweet Genevieve</i> no
more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Do Something and You'll Find Out</i>"</p>


<p>In Attalia, there is a street which includes all that goes
with Ethiopian. It is called Dalton street, and along its
narrow way&mdash;for it is narrow, and one of the oldest
streets in the city&mdash;occurs much that is deplorable.</p>

<p>On this selfsame street, an incident took place, in
which Sidney Wyeth happened to figure as more than
the casual observer.</p>

<p>It was in late afternoon of a cold wet day. He had
been delivering books, and had a considerable amount
of the proceeds of the delivery in his pockets, when,
while on the way to the office, he chanced to be passing
down this street. He looked up, and found himself
before a large, odd appearing structure. A uniformed
man stood at the front, and, in passing, Wyeth paused a
moment, took in the proportions of the building with a
critical gaze, and inquired of the man what it was.</p>

<p>The other looked at him with an expression which
seemed to say: "You ought to know!" But grinning,
he replied:</p>

<p>"Do something and you'll damn quick find out! It's
the police station."</p>

<p>"M-m-m-m! You wouldn't be likely to find out if
you didn't, I suppose," he laughed, as he continued on
his way.</p>

<p>During Sidney Wyeth's bachelor life on the <i>Rosebud</i>,
he had been a victim of the habit of going to town, and
loafing the night through, occasionally. There had, in
the beginning, been a great deal of gambling there, and
to watch this was an absorbing pastime. It served, also,
as he then felt, as a diversion to break the monotony of
his lonesome life.</p>

<p>Now there were places&mdash;if not gambling dens&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Attalia also, where one could loaf at night. When his
correspondence was completed that evening, he felt a
"Call of the Wild" in his blood, and went forth on a
pilgrimage of this kind. In company with a chauffeur,
he left for his room about one thirty A.M. the following
morning. They had not, however, gone far before the
clouds had gathered. They didn't see the clouds&mdash;at first&mdash;but
the clouds saw them. They happened to be a pair
of meddlesome bull-cops. It has been stated that the
hour was about one thirty, but the cops said two. Moreover,
they wished to know what business occasioned two
young men to be out at such an hour.</p>

<p>Sidney felt slightly insulted, and stepped aside to let
them by, thereby wishing to avoid any argument. The
cops stepped aside also, but to see that they did not get
too far out of the way. Said one&mdash;and he was the
burliest&mdash;"Well, boys, where have you been?" "Where
have we been?" said Wyeth, to himself. "Now wouldn't
that frost you!" What business of these men was it?
They had positively not been acting suspicious, nor were
they seen fighting, and neither were they drunk. So,
then, what right had two burley cops to get in the way,
and ask such impertinent questions. Sidney felt like
making an indignant reply, he felt like fighting; then he
did some quick thinking, and decided to be patient,
answering the questions in an offhand way, and so be
on his way, for he felt sleepy. And then, again, he
observed that they wore great big sticks, with which
they toyed idly, as they waited for reply.</p>

<p>"Aw, knocking around." It was Wyeth who made
this reply.</p>

<p>"Aw, knockin' 'roun'," said the big cop, who had
now grown ugly in the sight of Wyeth, and he repeated
this mockingly. And now spoke the chauffeur, who had
grown up in those parts. He was diplomatic. Said he:</p>

<p>"I'm jes' gettin' off frum we'k, cap'n," and despite
his look of truth and sincerity, he trembled perceptibly.</p>

<p>Sidney observed him with a touch of disgust.</p>

<p>"Is that so-o?" said the cop, more sneeringly now
than ever. Sidney had enough, and started to go by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
but the blue-coat blocked his way roughly, and cried out,
with club grasped: "Where yu' been, nigger?"</p>

<p>Wyeth was shocked beyond speech. Evidently, he
had not as yet come to appreciate that he was otherwise
than on the <i>Rosebud</i>. "Where you been, nigger?"
came the terrible voice once more.</p>

<p>Wyeth woke up. Moreover, he became obviously
frightened. He replied&mdash;and lo! He was trembling also,
as he cried:</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Policeman!" He was now
wild-eyed. "I'm not breaking the law; I have done
nothing; I am on the way to my room and to bed. Why
do you hold me up this way. I don't think I am obliged
to answer such questions as you ask; but I have been
calling, I cannot see that it matters where, since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw don't talk to the man lak dat," whimpered the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>"I'll knock your damned head off, nigger! What'n
Hell's got int' you to talk to a white man like that!"
He turned his face to the other who had not, up to then,
said anything, and said: "Let's arrest them!" The
other acquiesced. "Come on!" he roared, grabbing the
chauffeur by the belt of his trousers, and whirling him
about. The other caught Sidney likewise, but was more
civil in the act.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Mister," said he to his cop, "why are
you arresting us? We have done nothing!"</p>

<p>"Got orders to pick up everybody after one o'clock
who looks <i>suspicious</i>, and cannot give good accounts of
themselves," he replied soberly.</p>

<p>"I wish I had known it," Wyeth sighed wearily;
"but I'm at least glad that I didn't have him lead me,"
he said, pointing to the cop who had the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"You made him mad," grinned the patrolman. "You
must not live here?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord, and I wish at this moment I had never
come."</p>

<p>"When a white man speaks to you down here, always
answer him 'sir!'" he advised.</p>

<p>"I most assuredly will, if I meet any more like him,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
said Sidney meekly. After a moment of silence as they
stumbled along, he said thoughtfully: "I hate this. I've
never been arrested before in my life. Will they lock
us up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure!" the other laughed.</p>

<p>"M-m-m-m&mdash;m!"</p>

<p>"Jes' lemme go this time, Mister," whined the chauffeur
ahead, "'n' I won' neve' be out late no mo'."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, son," said the bull-cop a little kindly,
"but it's impossible. I o'n' think you are bad 'tall, but
that other nigger's crooked, 'n' I know he is," he said,
pointing back at Wyeth. He was overheard, and despite
the precarious condition Wyeth realized he was in, he
smiled.</p>

<p>"He's sho got a bad 'pinion a-you, son," laughed
Wyeth's cop.</p>

<p>"I'll go t' bed eve' night at nine 'clock&mdash;eight 'f you
say so," begged the chauffeur, as they neared the patrol
box.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for the "wagon," the copper
with the chauffeur in charge turned that worthy over to
the other cop, and ran across the street to intercept
another Negro. That one happened to be a waiter who
worked at night, and was, accordingly, allowed to go his
way; but he had been off work since ten o'clock. Wyeth
and the chauffeur had left him at the palm garden when
they departed, but that was no argument now. The
other went his way, whistling cheerfully, while they stood
prisoners of the law.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful experience for Sidney Wyeth.</p>

<p>A mighty but familiar jingling of bells proclaimed that
the "wagon" was on the way, and in an incredibly short
time they were pushed inside. As the door closed, with
a bigger cop than the others between the culprits (?) and
the door, these words came to Wyeth's ears: "Idling
and Loitering!"</p>

<p>"Youse the cause a-this," accused the chauffeur
angrily.</p>

<p>Wyeth laughed outright.</p>

<p>"How c'n you laf 'n' us on the way t' the lock-up!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyeth laughed in earnest now, while the bull smiled
naively.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd a-neve' seen you," said the other wearily.</p>

<p>"It's vain to make such wishes now;" and then something
occurred to him. He had been to the bank, but
had, fortunately, not deposited all he had. "Say, Governor,"
he cried, "if a man should put up money when he
is taken before the clerk, or whoever it is that receives
us, would they allow him to return without locking him
up?" His inquiry was eager. The other replied:</p>

<p>"Most assuredly."</p>

<p>"Good! How much will I have to put up to keep from
being locked up?"</p>

<p>"About ten dollars and seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>Wyeth did some counting. "I have ten fifty. Will
they let me out on that?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"What you goin' do 'bout me?" put in the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Do about you!" said Wyeth. "What you going to
do about yourself? I'm not your guardian."</p>

<p>"But I ain' got bu' fifty cents," he wailed despairingly.</p>

<p>"Then methinks you will sleep on Dalton street tonight."</p>

<p>They had arrived at the station by this time. Wyeth
recalled a few hours before with a feeling of awe, as he
recognized the place and the words the man had used.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded the clerk of the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Boise Demon."</p>

<p>"Yours!"</p>

<p>Wyeth gave it, and as the clerk made a record of it,
he made inquiry regarding a bond.</p>

<p>"All right. Ten seventy-five."</p>

<p>"I have but ten fifty."</p>

<p>"See the sargent."</p>

<p>"What's the charge?" inquired that orderly, coming
forward.</p>

<p>"Id'ling and loitering."</p>

<p>"Let him off for ten."</p>

<p>"Pay me out, pay me out!" trembled the chauffeur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut up!" commanded Sidney. "Haven't you heard
me say I had but ten fifty?"</p>

<p>"Then do'n go, do'n go; stay with me!"</p>

<p>"Like Hell, I will!" exclaimed Wyeth with a laugh.
The officers standing about, laughed also, and said:</p>

<p>"Don't be 'fraid, honey. You'll have lots a-company."</p>

<p>Wyeth handed over ten dollars, and a moment later
passed into the street where a soft rain was falling.
"Jesus," he muttered; "I'm sure glad I kept that
money." And then, ere he had got far, he heard a cell
door clang, and thought about Demon. At the same
moment, there came to his ears the music of many
throats singing: "Don't you leave me here!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Jedge L'yles' Co't</i>"</p>


<p>Wyeth sneaked into the room without waking Thurman
that morning. Nor did he inform him of his good
fortune, when the other arose two hours later to go to
work. He did not sleep any that night, and, since he
had to be to the court at eight-thirty or forfeit his bond,
he arose early, dressed, and in due time, he sat in the large
theatre.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Sidney Wyeth had suspected what would
come to pass that morning, he would have forfeited the
bond by not putting in his appearance; but when he
put up the collateral the night before, he had observed
a mark of respect in the officers. He was sufficiently
acquainted with the courts from a distance, to realize
that the average Negro brought before that tribunal&mdash;with
the possible exception of a boot-legger&mdash;seldom
brought any money or had any at home, and invariably
went in great numbers to the stockade. Moreover, the
sargent and the clerk, too, had advised him that he
might not possibly be fined at all. Therefore, when he
left for the court, he had no thought other than that he
would go free, and have his money returned.</p>

<p>"It will, of course," they had said, "depend upon how
Judge Loyal feels when you appear."</p>

<p>He had heard something regarding this "feeling"
before. He meditated as he made his way in that direction.
And still he recalled more of what he had heard,
which was to the effect that if "his stomach was upset,
look out!"</p>

<p>He hoped Judge Loyal didn't suffer with dyspepsia or
indigestion....</p>

<p>As he neared that place he now remembered so well,
he was overwhelmed with memories. He recalled this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
same court, more than ten years before. It was in a
leading magazine. It was, moreover, he recalled, an
interesting story, too. "Wonder if it will prove so
today," he mused silently....</p>

<p>And now he was inside the court room. He was early,
and so were many others. He recalled, with another
twitch of the memory, that Judge Loyal had presided
ten years before. He would see him today. "There he
is now," he said to himself, as an old man with white
hair came upon the platform, and took a seat behind the
bench.</p>

<p>But it was the clerk. Judge Loyal came later, so did
others, many others.</p>

<p>And now all that he had read in that article many
years before, suddenly came back to him clearly. It
overwhelmed him. The article concerned that court&mdash;and
Negroes&mdash;Negroes&mdash;Negroes&mdash;a court of Negroes.
And now he was a part of them. Although on the outside,
he felt guilty. He was supposed to answer when
his name was called.</p>

<p>The court room was filling rapidly. They were herded
behind huge doors, to the left of the room. Black men
and a few whites. A mass of criminal humanity. He
shuddered. He wished now to be over and out of it as
soon as possible. And then he experienced a cold fear.
It became stronger. It developed until it became a
chilly premonition that Judge Loyal (Jedge L'yles, as these
Negroes called him) would be feeling badly that day.
This feeling persisted until it became a reality.</p>

<p>It was now eight-forty. In ten minutes court would
begin. But still others came, and came, and came.
Women and men, boys and girls&mdash;even children. And
eighty per cent of them were Negroes, his people. Would
they never quit coming? What manner of business did
these people conduct that brought so many into court?
And at last came the judge. He was, in all appearance, a
young man. Evidently he was not, because Sidney had
been told that he had been on that bench for twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>Court was then opened. Inside a fencing, many white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
people sat in chairs. Who they were, or what part of the
proceeding they represented, he could not tell. Prisoners
were then being arraigned. From somewhere, he did not
see, but it was not from the detention room where the
"<i>great</i>" herd was, a young Negro of striking appearance
was led forward. He was tall and slender, and what
caught the attention of Sidney Wyeth was, that there
was nothing criminal in his appearance. He was about
twenty-five years of age, and wore shackles about his
ankles, as well as upon his wrists. He made a pathetic
picture. Sidney listened carefully, as he stood before the
judge, while talking in an undertone. He could not
hear what was said, but, presently, the prisoner was led
outside and away. He never learned what charge was
made against this young man, although he would have
liked to know.</p>

<p>On a table that stood to one side of the bench, behind
which the judge and clerk sat, were several cases of
liquor.</p>

<p>Evidence against some poor devil was strong, thought
Wyeth.</p>

<p>The gavel fell.</p>

<p>The first prisoner brought forward and placed before
the judge, was a Negro of medium size and height, and
about middle age. He did not possess the look of a
criminal either. In fact, not all of these people, or any
great part of them, appeared to be criminal, if Sidney
Wyeth had observed criminology correctly. Yet there
was a charge, himself for instance. This one was charged
with having been drunk and making a big noise.</p>

<p>He admitted the charge.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it," demanded Judge Loyal.</p>

<p>"On Dalton street."</p>

<p>"Who from?"</p>

<p>"A nigga."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"A nigga."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. What was his name?"</p>

<p>"Dunno."</p>

<p>"You don't know, yet you purchased enough liquor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
him to get drunk, whoop it up and disturb the peace of
the populace."</p>

<p>"Yassar."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see him before?"</p>

<p>"Nawsar."</p>

<p>"Was it corn whiskey or rye?"</p>

<p>"Niedda."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what was it?"</p>

<p>"Gin."</p>

<p>"Oh! Gin...."</p>

<p>"Sparrow Gin."</p>

<p>"Ten dollars and cost. Next!"</p>

<p>There was some delay before the next ones were brought
forward. When they came, there was some anxiety.
They were white men from one of the suburbs. As to
how they happened to be in this court was a matter for
conjecture; but the charge was fighting.</p>

<p>A witness mounted the stand by request.</p>

<p>"Your name is?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bill Sykes."</p>

<p>"William Sykes. Very well, William Sykes, what do
you know about this affair? Tell it to the court."</p>

<p>"Yer' 'onah, Judge," began Sykes, drawing his jeans
coat sleeve across his mouth. "Yistidy I left home 'bout
four a-clock 'n' come dawn to Abe Thomas' store, as I
usually do for some t'baccer."</p>

<p>"State what you know about this disturbance," cut in
the recorder's voice. "The court has nothing to do
about your tobacco."</p>

<p>"Well, 's I started to say. I come down after some
t'baccer.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Witness ordered removed from the stand. Put up
the next," commanded the judge.</p>

<p>Bill Sykes was summarily removed, as he muttered:
"This is shore an all fired place to tell somethin'."</p>

<p>"Your name is?"</p>

<p>"Silas Harris."</p>

<p>"Silas Harris, state briefly to the court what you
know about this case."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, Judge, yer 'onah. It was sho'tly afta' fo'
er-clock when I came down to Abe Thomas' store, 's I
always do to get a chaw t'baccer."</p>

<p>The judge looked disgusted. Silas resumed.</p>

<p>"'N' I wa'nt no morn' inside before Chris Tuttle says,
says he t' me, 'ah Si', says he t' me, ah gimme a chaw
t'baccer. Then I says to him, says I t' him, 'ah Chris,'
says I t' him, 'I ain' got no t'baccer, 'n' I jes' come down
t' see 'f I couldn't get a chaw of'n you!' says I t' him;
'but,' says I, says I t' him. 'I ain' got no t'baccer, Chris,'
says I t' him; 'but I God, I got some a 's good-a ole
rosin as yer ever broke a tooth on.'"</p>

<p>"Case Nolle-prossed."</p>

<p>Several Negroes were brought before the bar for
various misdemeanors, were fined and few dismissed,
while a great many were bound over. The next case to
arouse any special attention, pertained to two white
girls who were brought forward with drooped heads, and
made a picture that attracted the attention of the crowd.
The recorder frowned, as he observed then questioningly.</p>

<p>"What's the charge?" he inquired of the officer, who
presented himself as prosecutor.</p>

<p>"Soliciting."</p>

<p>"All right, prefer it."</p>

<p>"Your honor, Judge. I found these young women
hanging around Dewitt and Carlton streets this morning
about one o'clock, and advised them to 'beat' it. They
disappeared for a spell, but at a quarter past two they
were out again, and I heard them and saw them accost
several men who happened to be coming from work.
Presently a couple halted, and a few minutes later the
four disappeared within a rooming house. I had been
watching this house, and was positive it was crooked.
I followed them a little later, and when I was inside, I
looked about for a clerk and register that I did not find.
Then I overheard talking in low tones in a couple of the
rooms. When I knocked on the door, all was quiet and
the doors were not opened. I then demanded the doors
be opened in the name of the law. A scrambling followed,
I heard windows go up, and a little later men hit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ground below. When I entered the rooms I found these
young women alone, and put them under arrest."</p>

<p>The court room was very silent. All eyes were upon
the prisoners. The fact that the girls were both beautiful
seemed to provoke the judge, and he was very cold of
demeanor.</p>

<p>"What excuse have you to offer for such acts of indiscretion?"
he inquired presently, and eyed them
severely.</p>

<p>They both burst out crying and clung to each other,
which made a very pathetic picture. "We wasn't doing
anything, Mr. Judge. Not anything. We lived there
and the men were our husbands," said one, while the other
cried woefully. The recorder eyed them critically, before
speaking in a tone of extreme severity:</p>

<p>"Why, then, did they jump out the windows and run
away.... Don't you think that was very cowardly for
<i>husbands</i>?"</p>

<p>"O-oh," they cried now like two poor souls about to
enter purgatory. They almost made others cry, too.
But the judge was unbending. He looked forbidding, and
as cold as steel as he said:</p>

<p>"Young women like you two should exercise more
discretion. If you <i>must</i> conduct yourselves to the disgrace
of the community in such manner, you should keep
off the streets with your <i>men</i> at such ungodly hours.
I am, therefore, going to impose a fine of $10 and costs
upon each of you for delinquency. Next!"</p>

<p>"Boise Demon and Sidney Wyeth!" called the clerk
with his eyes on the docket.</p>

<p>The pair now stood facing the court.</p>

<p>"Your Honor," began the officer, who had Wyeth in
charge the night before, preferring the charge, "we found
these fellows at two o'clock this morning, going in the
direction of Warren street. And since, as you know, we
have orders to intercept all people whose appearance is
suspicious, and since they failed to give an account of
themselves that was satisfactory, we considered it expedient
to place them under arrest."</p>

<p>The recorder nodded his acquiescence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your name?" he inquired of the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Boise Demon."</p>

<p>"And yours?" of Wyeth.</p>

<p>"What's your occupation, Demon?"</p>

<p>"I'm a chauffeur 'n' wo'ks fo' Mr. Baron Ciders.
You know him. 'Es mah boss. 'Es got a office in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why weren't you at home in bed ten hours before
you were charged with being on the street?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Demon's jaw fell. Sidney looked discouraged.</p>

<p>It was a self-evident fact now that Judge Loyal's
stomach was out of order....</p>

<p>Demon's excuse was a variation that failed to impress
the judge as being the truth. Wyeth languidly resigned
himself to the inevitable.</p>

<p>"What is your occupation, Wyeth?" he now turned
his gaze upon Sidney.</p>

<p>He was told.</p>

<p>"What's your excuse for being upon the streets at two
A.M.?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" calmly.</p>

<p>The judge regarded him in silence, while the pair
waited for the sentence. Still the judge paused. As he
did so, Wyeth heard him belch slightly, as if decided.
A moment later came the words:</p>

<p>"Fine you fellows $5 and costs. You must keep off
the street loafing about all night. Next!"</p>

<p>They were turned about automatically, and then Wyeth
found himself looking down on a low, deformed creature.
He had been told about him also, and why he was deformed.</p>

<p>It had come about during a terrific race riot of a few
years before, and the incident will ever live in the history
of Attalia. It was then this creature became crippled.
He was, at the time, one of the strongest and most
capable officers on the force. But, upon being sent to
make an arrest, he happened onto a "bad" Negro, run
amuck. He was, to say the least, however, far more
fortunate than a dozen others, for they had been sent to
their happy hunting ground before the riot was quelled.
Since then, he had acted as a sort of bailiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Peeping up at Wyeth he said: "You have up collateral,
do you not?"</p>

<p>"Pay me out, pay me out!" cried Demon, at this
point.</p>

<p>Wyeth nodded.</p>

<p>"Then you step aside, and follow the officer downstairs
to the clerk's office," he instructed.</p>

<p>"Pay me out, pay me out!" from Demon again.</p>

<p>Wyeth frowned and pinched him good. "I wish to
confer in regard to this fellow," said he to hunchy, as
they were being waited for.</p>

<p>In the detention room, Demon secured a loan of fifty
cents from another miscreant, and a moment later, they
stood before the clerk.</p>

<p>When the fines had been paid, the officer said: "Now
Demon, you can go, but I am ordered to hold Wyeth as
a suspicious character."</p>

<p>"Well I'll be damned!" was all Wyeth said.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Take me at once before him," he cried, when they
were again in the court room, at the same time flashing
his check book which he had placed in his pocket for
precautionary measures. Demon had followed them
gratefully back up the stairs, and now stood about
muttering in a low tone: "Ain' that Hell, <i>ain' that
Hell</i>!" Wyeth motioned him aside, resolutely.</p>

<p>Once more he stood before his Honor. Upon recognizing
him, the recorder looked at the officer with a
question. His face had cleared of the frown it wore some
time before, and Wyeth concluded his stomach was better.</p>

<p>The officer preferred the charge, whereupon he looked
at Wyeth keenly. Wyeth made a motion. It was
granted.</p>

<p>"I dislike, very much, your Honor, to be kept in this
court room so unceremoniously. I am no criminal, and
my time is worth something. Now if I may be permitted
to put up more money, I have just paid a fine for being
out late for myself, as well as for another, and go my
way until this thing is done with, I'll appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Very well. Twenty-five dollars."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyeth paid it, and never returned to take it down.</p>

<p>When he got back to his room after it was all over,
thirty-six dollars to the bad, he opened the book of
resolutions and recorded therein:</p>

<p>"Resolved! That to give heed to the 'Call of the
Wild' in Attalia, is a very expensive diversion, albeit a
lesson; therefore, henceforth, twelve o'clock will find
me in the land of nod."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, kid, they tell me they had you," jollied
Spoon, when he saw Wyeth that evening at Hatfield's
ice cream parlor.</p>

<p>"You're breaking into print," laughed "Bubber" Hatfield,
unfolding a green sheet, <i>The Searchlight</i>, a sensational
four-page afternoon affair, which made a specialty
of court news, and which most colored people read.
They are fond of such news.</p>

<p>Frowning, while all those standing about laughed, he
took the sheet and read:</p>

<p class="center">NEGRO FROM THE NORTH WAS SURPRISED</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The following Saturday, he dropped into Tompkins'
and was introduced to a man who impressed him considerably.
At the first glance, he could see he was not a
southerner. Before he made his acquaintance, he overheard
him discussing books with Tompkins, and when
he heard him speaking of the latest works of fiction, he
opened his ears. To hear a Negro in Attalia discussing
novels, the late ones, was something new to him; in
fact, he had heard the most of those he met discuss but
one, a salacious one from the pen of a noted English
author and playwright, and which cannot be had at the
libraries, but is, nevertheless, a masterpiece.</p>

<p>He grasped his hand cordially, and they at once
entered into conversation. His name was Edwards.
"This gentleman," explained Tompkins, "is the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the book you and your friend were looking at this
afternoon." Edwards' eyebrows went up with considerable
pleasure, as he cried in a voice that was, to say
the least, cordial:</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am honored to meet a real author." Sidney,
however, was much embarrassed. He disliked to be
pointed out as an author among his people. The most of
those he met had impressed him with the feeling that an
author must be something extraordinary, and were usually
disappointed to find them only human beings like themselves.
Edwards, however, was not only an individual
of good breeding, but one with perspective, and quite
capable of appreciating an effort, regardless of what the
attainment might be.</p>

<p>Sidney had met few of his race, but who seemed to feel
that to write was to be graduated from a school, with a
name that was a fetish, and to be likewise a professor in
some college. In order to get material and color for a
work, they had not yet come to realize that it was best,
and much more original as well, to come in contact with
the people and observe their manner of living.</p>

<p>This may account, in a large degree, for the fact that
so many whom he met were impractical, even badly
informed.</p>

<p>Edwards and he became agreeable acquaintances at
once. "Come take dinner with me this evening," Edwards
invited, grasping Wyeth's arm, and leading him into the
restaurant next door, where he had already ordered
dinner. And such a meal! Wyeth had not realized that
it was in the range of possibilities for the little place to
prepare such a one. Moreover, to say that Edwards knew
how to order would be putting it mildly. He spared no
cost obviously, since the meal came to $3.75. Wyeth felt
guilty, when he recalled that he ate three times a day at
the same place, the kind termed "half meals," and which
came to fifteen cents per.</p>

<p>Before they had sat long, Edwards' friend came to the
table. And of all the Negroes Sidney had met, this one
was the most extraordinary. The son of a Japanese
mother and a Negro father, he had been educated abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
He spent his youth in Asia, lived a portion of his life in
Japan, the remainder in America and was a Buddhist.
One Negro at least who didn't spell "ligon."</p>

<p>History and science, from the beginning of time&mdash;before
Adam whom he scorned, astronomy, astrology, meteorology,
the zodiac and the constellations, in fact, he
seemed to know everything. Sidney, anxious always to
learn what he did not know, could only sit with mouth
wide open, while the other declared Jesus of Nazareth,
Noah, the flood, Adam and Eve, and all the rest, the
biggest liars the world ever knew.</p>

<p>When Sidney had occasion to speak of him to religious
Negroes in after-months, they would say: "Shucks! He
couldn't a-convinced me 'gainst mah Jaysus." And he
would then be sorry. Sidney "believed" as much as any
one else of moderate intelligence, and his acquaintance
with the unusual Negro had no effect whatever upon him
as a believer; but he knew that many of those who
professed so much faith in "Jaysus" and cried: "We is
God fearin' fo'kes," were mere "feelers" who had no
thought of God whatever, in the sense he should be
regarded and respected. Indeed, they did not fear him.
They feared but one thing, these black people, and that
was the white man, which belongs to another chapter.</p>

<p>"I grant all you say to be quite possible, my dear sir,"
said he, when the other paused in his serious discourse;
"but, having been raised to the Christian faith, I am,
therefore, a hopeless believer. I do, nevertheless, respect
your point of view and your faith, and am glad indeed
to have met you," which ended it.</p>

<p>Edwards proved to be a graduate of Yale, and was well
informed in every way, as Sidney suspected.</p>

<p>He had always found it this way. The great fault he
was finding daily with those of his race, was that they did
not read, did not observe, and were not informed in the
many things they could just as well have known.</p>

<p>As the days went by, Sidney's friendship with Edwards
developed to the point, where Edwards insisted upon
paying half the rent for the privilege of loafing in the
office whenever he was at leisure. Sidney did not inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
his business, or what he was engaged in; but his curiosity
was aroused nevertheless. His friend always had plenty
of money and spent it not foolishly, but freely. He never
permitted Wyeth to pay for anything, and he never ate
a meal that came to less than two dollars.</p>

<p>After a few days, another fellow joined him, who,
while surrounded with an air of mystery, did not happen
to possess so much apparent education. His name was
Smyles, and he purported to be from Boston. At the
same time acknowledged Alabama to be his birth place.
He still carried the accent. He was dark of visage, had
long legs, and wore trousers around them, which appeared
never to have been pressed. (Wyeth wondered why some
of the many pressing clubs did not kidnap him alive.)
His head was small and obviously hard, and he wore his
top hair so closely cropped, that no one could quite
describe what kind it was.</p>

<p>Now Smyles was a sport, likewise a spender, and,
moreover, with money a-plenty to spend. And, as the
days passed and Wyeth became better acquainted with
him, he learned that he was "mashed" on the girls to a
considerable degree. For instance: There was Lucy,
who waited on them at Miss Payne's cafe, who got
"crazy" about him. He did about her, too, for awhile,
at least he pretended to. Then he became interested
likewise in another who had "better hair" than Lucy.
Thereupon Lucy became "mad" with jealousy, and
threatened to do something "awful." She didn't, so we
leave her to her fate, and go on with Smyles who becomes,
for the present, the hero of this story.</p>

<p>"Smyles is a great fellow," remarked Sidney humorously
to Edwards, one day.</p>

<p>"Isn't he the limit?" said Edwards, with a touch of
disgust.</p>

<p>"All the girls are liking him," resumed Sidney, enjoying
the conversation and discussion.</p>

<p>"Takes with all the kitchen mechanics, and anything
else that wears a skirt." Edwards had dignity, a great
deal of it, Wyeth had come now to know. He was plainly
disgusted. Sidney went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has lots of money to spend, which makes it exceedingly
convenient."</p>

<p>"He's the luckiest coon in town," said Edwards
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Shoots craps I think."</p>

<p>"And wins, evidently."</p>

<p>That Wyeth might not gather an adverse opinion of
him&mdash;or rather, a questionable one, Edwards had informed
him that he was connected with a northern
philanthropic organization. Wyeth assumed that he was
connected with something of the kind, and that he was
actually the recipient of plenty of the dispensation.
Every Monday he would go uptown, and return with a
roll. Most of this would be spent by the next Monday,
which was unusual.</p>

<p>He didn't gamble, but better light will be thrown on
this later.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>About a year before, there had been committed in
Attalia, a most dastardly murder. A man, a Jew he was,
had killed a little girl, a gentile. This murder had occasioned
more comment in those sections, than had anything
in the way of crime for a decade. We stated that
the Jew had killed the girl; it should have been said
that he was <i>accused</i> of having killed her.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs in regard to the murder
at the time of our story. Notwithstanding the fact that
the Jew was accused of the murder, the charge against
him, and the public sentiment in particular, had reached
a very serious stage. It would have been very serious
for any one to be accused of such a crime in those parts,
be she gentile, Jewess, or anyone with a white face.</p>

<p>The body of this girl had been found in the basement
of a factory, at which she was employed at a very small
wage, foully murdered. It was a mystery at first, as to
who was the murderer. A Negro had been arrested and
charged with the crime. It appeared that he was surely
guilty; but he wasn't&mdash;at least so it was decided shortly
afterwards. It was confidentially whispered about town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to this day, and may be for all time, that he was a lucky
Negro, too. Because, with the way they treat Negroes
accused of doing much less serious things in a part of
this country, he was fortunate to have been accused in
Attalia, where protection is quite ample now, and not in
some of the smaller places&mdash;but we are digressing.</p>

<p>Evidently he was not felt to be guilty, and, moreover,
since suspicion was quickly diverted to the Jew.
And yet he, the Negro, had been discovered in the back
yard of the factory, washing a bloody shirt. Such incriminating
evidence! For some reason, the people could
not seem to bring themselves to feel that the Negro had
sense enough to kill the girl, had he wished to. He was
put through a severe examination of some length, and
finally confessed to having helped the real murderer
dispose, or try to dispose of the body after it was all over.
It was, of course, duly found and as duly buried. It was,
thereafter, exhumed two or three times, as evidence for
the state. The Jew was discovered acting very peculiarly
a few days after the murder. So they had taken him into
custody to ascertain the cause of these actions. Accusations
followed, and he was in time brought before the
high tribunal on a charge of murder, convicted and
sentenced to be hanged until dead, however long that
might be. The date of execution was set for a day, which
happened to be the same day a year later, than that upon
which he was supposed to have committed the deed.</p>

<p>Thus our story found it.</p>

<p>Sentencing a man to be hanged, and hanging him,
however, are two very different things. Yet the court
persisted. It was determined to carry out the decision
of the jury of "twelve good men and true,"<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> this Jew, scion
of Jacob, of Israel, of Solomon, and Job, and others, had
money at his back, plenty of it, as we shall see presently;
and they were spending it lavishly, to save his neck,
which was long. Perhaps that explains what came to
pass later.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The counsel for the defense hired a detective, <i>A
Great Detective</i>. The greatest detective in all the world.
No one can deny this, since he said so himself, at least
this is how he was quoted by a paper, which, for the
purpose of this story, we shall call the "Big Noise."
It was a "noise," too. But, to get back to the detective,
<i>The Great Detective</i>.</p>

<p>The leading papers corroborated the fact that he was
the greatest in the world, and so he shall be, in this story,
as well. We are compelled to quote the "Big Noise"
again. It claimed, very urgently, that these papers were
paid to corroborate the detective. So be it.</p>

<p>The leading dailies and the greatest detective in the
world got together, with a view to obtaining a new trial
for the Jew, after which they hoped, of course, in some
subtle manner, to extricate him from his very embarrassing
predicament.</p>

<p>The detective did the posing, and he was <i>some</i> poser,
and the papers did the rest. The most obstinate proposition
which they were up against, was that the people
believed the Jew to be guilty, but naturally read the
papers.</p>

<p>Now The Great Detective's picture had been seen by
almost everybody who read, or ever had read anything,
so we must appreciate that he was a familiar figure. But,
in addition to what had occurred in regard to the detective,
more came to pass. Pages of the Sunday edition
were devoted to his cut, and other pages to his ability
as a mystery solver. From the way the papers wrote of
him and reproduced his pose, he made Sherlock Holmes,
Raffles, Arsene Lupin, and even Nick Carter, look like
thirty cents with the three invisible.</p>

<p>He began, in opening the case, a series of angles. At
first, of course, he viewed it from an Attalia angle.
Forthwith, after this, he went to Chicago and viewed it
from a windy angle. From St. Louis, he viewed it from
a "show me" angle; and while he was out that way, he
chased across to Kansas City, and saw it from that angle.
And 'ere anyone was aware of it, he had crossed the
prairies to Denver, and viewed it from a mountain angle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Behold then, upon picking up the morning paper, where
the great detective has reached New York, and was
viewing the case from that angle; but space will not
permit of recording further these many angles indulged
in by <i>the greatest detective in the world</i>, for the defendant
in the case of the state versus the Jew.</p>

<p>All of these angles were followed with much color by
the Attalia papers. Moreover, papers elsewhere mysteriously
took up the Jew's cause, by following the angles
of the detective. All except the "Big Noise." It was
busy viewing the detective from its angle. But it was
not, of course, endowed with such an abundance of
readers, therefore, for the time, it was not noticed much.
It was later, however.</p>

<p>Now we come to the most extraordinary phase of the
case, leaving the prisoner in his cell for the present.</p>

<p>While all this angling was going on, witnesses who had
testified for the state, and whose testimony had resulted
disasterously for the defendant, began to come up mysteriously,
with affidavits to the effect that what they
had sworn to was a falsehood, no, a lie! Many of them
declared, in these affidavits, that they were inspired to
make these statements, that they might face their God
with the truth on their lips! The city became chaotic.
No one had even suspected that the city possessed such
people. This renouncing of testimony developed into an
almost everyday affair. "Everybody was doin' it". So
it came to pass, in an incredibly short time, that almost
every one who had supplied damaging testimony against
the Jew, had renounced it.</p>

<p>The newspapers were the most interesting things to
read in Attalia during this spell. But more mysteries
followed in due order. Every one who produced, or had
produced an affidavit, renouncing his or her previous
testimony, became automatically prosperous, no, we'll
have to change this statement. They did, and again
they didn't. Alas! Some had not received all they had
been mysteriously promised, it seems. And still others,
unaccustomed to wealth, and feeling that money is rightfully
the medium for the good things they had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
been able to enjoy, including liquor, proceeded to fulfill
this long felt desire. So, many got drunk. And, trust
John Barleycorn to do the rest, they imparted secrets to
their near friends. And then, of course, the friends imparted
such illuminating information to their friends,
whereupon it was duly imparted, in time, to the people
through the paper.</p>

<p>Truth combined with a conscience, is always a danger,
a menace to falsity. And, of course, not every one possesses
the strength to stand on a falsehood, therefore&mdash;and
in an incredibly short time&mdash;affidavits began to be voluntarily
offered by these many, to the effect that the
renunciation was a falsehood; the original testimony
was true, quite true. Accompanying many of these latter
affidavits, was money.</p>

<p>We are reminded at this point of Judas and the thirty
pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Conspicuous throughout the trial, and conducting the
prosecution, was one Doray, the solicitor, and he was
there, very much so. Doray became quite busy about
this time. He had ambition, and was being mentioned
for the governorship. So the state, with its many poor
people and slim treasury, labored relentlessly in the
prosecution, while the purse of the Jew seemed to have

<p>We return to <i>The Great Detective</i>, the greatest one in
all the world.</p>

<p>Naturally, when he began, with the reputation he possessed,
with the notorious angling, with hundreds of
newspapers all over the country supporting him, and
from the fact that he had uncovered many dark plots,
many people took notice. A half dozen extra editions
was the average per day, but some days they reached a
dozen, all replete with subtle mystery. The populace
lived in an ecstacy of expectation. They were hurdled
between so many conflictions, until they knew not what
they were expecting. But, as the days went by and the
mystery deepened, they glared dry-eyed at the headlines
of the many extras, expecting at last that the greatest
detective in the world would lead forth a diabolical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
creature otherwise than the Jew, declaring, and subsequently
proving him to be the murderer.</p>

<p>He did, but he was not a man of mystery.</p>

<p>The announcement came in a blazing morning extra.
Shops were forgotten, people gathered upon the streets,
blocked the corners, and everything became a medley of
excitement, as the news became general.</p>

<p>"The real murderer of a little innocent girl has been
found!"</p>

<p>The population waited in abated breath. In the order
in which he had reported, or as had been reported by the
papers, the detective set a day upon which he would
point, with the forefinger of his right hand, straight to
the murderer.</p>

<p>The day would never come, everybody seemed to feel.
All the anxiety attendant during the trial, before as well
as after, for it must be understood that the Jew had not
been seen to kill the girl, was lived over again during this
spell. But at last the mighty day came. It was a dark,
drizzly, gloomy, forlorn day. Just the kind for what was
now the order in Attalia. On this day, the people now
felt, the real murderer would be placed in the lime light.
The detective had declared, a few days after he had been
retained and put on the case, that the Jew was innocent.
Moreover, he declared that the prosecution, abetted by
public sentiment, had been affected in its decision, by
the worst of all that is inherent in our advanced society,
race prejudice. He lied here&mdash;and knew it. There is
no prejudice in Attalia against any race but one, of which
we will pass. In addition, he flaunted in the face of the
people, the idea of perversion on the part of the Jew, of
which the latter had been accused. This accusation had
been advanced as the only excuse for the murder, of
which he stood accused. But the real murderer was that
day announced as per reports.</p>

<p>"Jim Dawkins," cried the detective, "killed that girl!
So now, free this poor man thou hast persecuted these
many months, and hang that murderer, that beast, that
pervert, for he is guilty!"</p>

<p>It was some time before the people recovered. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of them had to pinch themselves to be quite sure they
were awake; for it was positively incredible, after all
this waiting, after all this angling, after all the mystery,
that this detective, the greatest one in all the world, by
his own admission and that of the press, should come
right back to where the case had begun.</p>

<p>Jim Dawkins was the Negro accused in the first instance.</p>

<p>And now we hear from the "Big Noise"&mdash;and it made
some noise now. Moreover, the public, with a relief
from their long tension, began to hear it. Its editor had
once run for president, on a ticket we cannot recall;
moreover, he had the reputation of being opposed to
every man elected to anything in the state and the
United States. This included the democrats, of whom
he, although a southerner, was not one.</p>

<p>The people now bought and read his paper with as
much eagerness as they had the others, in the beginning.</p>

<p><i>The Great Detective</i> was absent for a week following his
sensational discovery. (?) Then he returned, but alas!
The day of angles had become contagious, as we shall
see presently.</p>

<p>Following his return, he happened to go to a nearby
town to view the case from that angle. This town happened
to have been the home of the murdered girl. So,
when the great detective whirled into town, seated in
the tonneau of a huge automobile, they proceeded at
once to entertain him with true southern chivalry. (?)</p>

<p>A night extra told all about it, before he had returned
to Attalia, which was marvelous, when one considers this
place was only twenty miles away, and from reports, the
car took its highest speed on the return, at least it did
in leaving the other town. But, lest we forget, the eggs
used at this entertainment could not all have been
guaranteed as the freshest. And with a few more words,
we leave this story.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Edwards and Smyles took their
leave. Wyeth missed them considerably, for he had
grown very fond of them about the office. When they
were far, far away, the mystery connected with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
occupation was still unsolved. Then, one day while
Sidney was folding up an old newspaper, his eye happened
to fall upon an article of two paragraphs. It related to
an incident that cleared up the whole thing, and was to
the effect that, while doing some sleuthing on the ground
floor, Smyles had, after refusing to explain the occasion
of his mysterious action, been arrested and locked up for
an hour, at the end of which the great detective had come
forward and got him out.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blowed!" exclaimed Sidney, for it
revealed that his two friends were detectives, in the
employ of the noted chief, and hired, no doubt, to view
the case from a "dark" angle. But the most extraordinary
part of it all, was that their names were not
Smyles nor Edwards either, but&mdash;I guess it doesn't
matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Cause Nigga's 's Gittin' so Rich</i>"</p>


<p>In the building to the furthest end from where Wyeth's
office was now located, he observed a man one day. He
was standing in front of the bank. He was a white man,
and was tall and slender, while his complexion was sandy,
his hair red and awry. His eyes were keen and piercing.
"A collector," thought Sidney, for there were so many
about the building, especially on Monday, and this was
the day. He lurked in the entry on Tuesday, when
Wyeth passed that way. "Must be a contractor, the
way he is studying the inside of the bank," mumbled
Wyeth, as he took the elevator upward.</p>

<p>Wednesday came, gray and gloomy, and then it rained.
It was four o'clock and thirty minutes in the afternoon.
Sidney passed through the entry to the elevator on his
way to the office of Dickson, and again the man stood
there. He had drawn no conclusion as to what was the
occasion of this presence, when from behind came a
sound. He did something else then. So did others
about him.</p>

<p>"Throw up your hands, nigger, and get into that
vault!" came a command.</p>

<p>It was from the man he had seen, and he was holding
up the bank.</p>

<p>There was a silence, followed by a scuffle, then a lull,
and a shot, and still later,&mdash;for the shot went wild,
landing in the ceiling where it cracked the plastering,
and made bits of it fall upon a score of frightened
Negroes&mdash;a thud. This had not gone amiss. There was
a groan and a dull sound, as some one sank to the floor.
This part was witnessed by Wyeth and others. It was
the teller, and the son of the bank's president. On the
floor he lay bleeding, while the other was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
frightened over him. Then he looked up. Open-mouthed
like dumb creatures, Negros of all shades, including the
green, stood about. And then the man seemed to awaken
to the emergency, and the danger.</p>

<p>Those Negroes would not be dumb for all time. He
sensed this aright. And then he took initiative, action.
With a flash, he fired off the huge gun, and with a leap
and a bound, he came forth, while Negroes, black and
brown, yellow and green, and some white, fell back upon
each other, in a hurry. He had plenty of room, for a time,
and made use of it. Out into the hallway he must perforce
come on his way to the street, and freedom. He
started, but one little moment he hesitated. Then, firing
again, he made his great rush. Through the hallway he
dashed, and entered the street through a side door that
was open before him. A moment later he was gone.</p>

<p>But so were the others.</p>

<p>They were led by a barber, who shaved black faces
next door. He was a mulatto with a flat nose, which
made his appearance grotesque. With a roar like that of
a mad guerilla, he ran in hot pursuit. Away they went,
all of them now, including Wyeth.</p>

<p>The barber led the others by far, and in his hand,
open for action, was a razor. It seemed quite large to
Wyeth as it glistened in the sunlight, for the day had
cleared. Perhaps he was seeing double, but he followed
while the "victim"&mdash;which we shall call the other&mdash;preceded
the other only slightly. The barber was breaking
wind now, but gaining nevertheless.</p>

<p>As Wyeth followed in that dark pursuit, a picture of
the possible consequences rose before him. This Negro,
scion of two races, embittered by an instance in our
history that will never die, was wild. Blood, blue blood,
it was he thirsted. All the hatred of a thousand or more
years was now privileged, by the unwritten law, to give
vent. This other has attempted crime&mdash;the robbery of
the people's where-with-all. To kill him now was to get
revenge, revenge upon those who have long since died&mdash;and
go scott free!</p>

<p>Perhaps the other appreciated this point of view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>He rushed pellmell, wildly through the street he came
into, and turned at the end up another that led, whither,
he did not take time to think or to consider. It seemed
impossible for the man to escape dire consequences, as
Sidney Wyeth saw him now. He wished he could save
him, but he did not know how. Only a few steps ahead,
the culprit led the other. It was only a question of
minutes&mdash;a minute. And then&mdash;horrors!</p>

<p>Up this new street, which happened to be Herald, they
went, and closer and closer the Negro came to the victim.
He was breaking wind fearfully. A block had been
covered, when, ahead to the left stood a laundry with
doors wide open. Then, suddenly, when abreast of it,
the victim plunged into it, but so did the barber. Others
followed, and workers fell back amazed. To the rear the
chase led, and then, lo! A brick wall faced the victim,
with a closed door only. This door could not be opened
in time! That appeared to settle it! The poor creature,
frightened out of his wits, fell to the floor, and then rose
to one knee, with hands stretched Heavenward. At last
the end had come. The Negro now, the picture of which
our pen cannot describe, stood over him with razor upraised,
and eyes dancing with murder like huge coals of
fire. "Don't cut me with that razor, Mister," the victim
whimpered. He pushed the other back until he was
against the door. For the first time in his life, Sidney
Wyeth was to see a man killed. One moment he looked.
The sunlight played through a transom window, falling
strangely upon the blade of that poised razor. He closed
his eyes to shut out the fearful sight. The next moment,
he opened them as he heard a noise&mdash;a momentous
instant. It was the opening of the door, against which
the victim had been pushed.</p>

<p>A moment later, the two went over the steps a-tumble,
below; but the razor had flown in a direction which they
had not gone, and the tension was relieved.</p>

<p>Soon, the victim emerged from the rear, and another
chase began; but the razored Negro was then far to the
rear. He eluded his pursuers for a moment during the
mix-up. But suddenly in chorus they cried:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dere 'e goes, cetch 'im!"</p>

<p>The crowd had now grown to a mob, a sullen mob.
They cried out in loud tones for blood, blue blood; but
the culprit was illusive. A street car was passing, and
into it he vaulted. "I've shot a coon," he cried; "and
the niggers are after me!" The car lunged forward as
the mob reached the door, whereupon they looked into
the muzzle of a revolver held in the hand of the conductor,
as he commanded: "Stand back!" They did,
but 'ere he had gone far, there came to his ears from the
crowd in the rear:</p>

<p>"'S robbed d' bank! 'Es robbed d' bank!"</p>

<p>The conductor immediately rang to stop. The victim
rang to go forward. The motorman obeyed the former,
and the car slowed down. The victim leaped off before
it came to a halt, while at the rear, the mob, howling like
a bunch of savages, came on in mad fury.</p>

<p>Then he tore across the street to where an old man,
with bent shoulders and flowing white beard, sat half
asleep in a buggy. He rushed to the side of this, and
permitted the old relic to smell the muzzle, as he cried:
"Unload!" The old man did, in a pile. The victim
jumped in, and, jerking the whip from the socket, brought
the old horse, half asleep also, to appreciate the state
of affairs, by dealing him a blow that made his tail stick
out, as his legs speeded up the street. The crowd roared
diabolically, as they saw themselves being left to the
rear; but many on bicycles gave chase, and followed in
close pursuit. He suddenly drew his revolver, and let go
the trigger, which made a flash, point blank in their
midst. That settled it. One fell to the street with a
sad, sickening cry, an arm limp at his side. The others
gave up, turned back, and quickly went the other way.</p>

<p>And then he disappeared.</p>

<p>Wyeth had returned to the scene of the opening&mdash;so
had the rest. And the crowd, combined with those who
had gathered about the bank in the meantime, filled
Audubon Avenue the entire length of the building, a
block and a half on the side. All was uproar. Report
followed report, and each flashed through the crowd with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
much comment. He had, so the news ran, been captured
here, and everywhere. As it stood, he had not been
captured at all. Opinions, expressions, conclusions and
rejections were in order on all sides. One was to the
effect that the big banks uptown, conducted by "whi'
fo'kes," had conspired the deal on account of fear,
"'cause nigga's 's a-gittin so rich 'n 'a-posit'n they
money in the cullud bank, ontell dem whi' fo'kes done
'trigued' and got dat low down po' whi' man t' come and
tri' t' frustrate us 'spectable cullud fo'kes." And again
there came to the ears of Sidney another report, and this
was one of graver concern.</p>

<p>"Robbers 'roun' a-stealin' d' money, go'n be fus' one
dare in d' mawnin' t' draw mine out!"</p>

<p>"Gwan, you fool nigga! Yu' ain' got nothin' in dere;
'n' yu' aut a-be run outta town fo' talkin' lak dat!"</p>

<p>"Who dat obber dare, da' whi' man dressed so 'maculete
wi' du soft hat?"</p>

<p>"Dat's Judson, d' 'porter on d' Jou'nal."</p>

<p>"Who dat udder one wi' a big nose 'n' dark 'plection!"</p>

<p>"Ain' you ebber been 'rested, nigga, 'n' up a-fo' Jedge
Ly'l's, 'n' seen 'im a-hangin' 'roun'? Dat's Jempsy, d'
putective."</p>

<p>"Lis'n! lis'n! Wha' dat! Dey has captured 'im!"
Forthwith, to another point they rushed, through a
bunch collected around the barber, who was then telling
and retelling "'Ow close ah come t' gittin' 'im."</p>

<p>It was not a report this time, but the ambulance that
was taking the wounded teller to his home. The sight
of him, with bandaged head as a result of the attempt,
served to renew the local race animosity.</p>

<p>"Ah sho 's go'n kill me a whi' man, so 'elp me Jaysus!"
muttered a dinge, as the carriage passed him by, while
all about dark faces scowled ominously.</p>

<p>Darkness was approaching, when an authentic report
came at last, to the ears of the crowd. The would-be
robber had really been captured, and it was the papers
that gave forth the news.</p>

<p>His name, so he said, was Rhynata, a "vaudevillian,"
who hailed from Denver. His capture had been thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had eluded the mob, by holding up the old
man for his horse and buggy, he followed that street for
only a block, when he turned into another. After the
crowd was lost, he left the buggy, and walked hurriedly
up the street, turned a corner, and disappeared in the
basement of a house.</p>

<p>A plainclothes man, some while later, happened to pass
that way in trying to locate him, and followed him
therein. When he got to the second story, he came into
a room where a woman was bathing, with a damp towel,
the head of a man in bed. He backed up, begging pardon,
and turned to leave. As he was passing a dresser, in a
half open drawer, his eye espied a revolver which his
hand forthwith touched. The barrel was warm, which
told the rest of the story.</p>

<p>The settlement began the next day before Judge Loyal.
His court room was filled that day, but the greatest
crowd was outside. The man was duly identified as the
culprit, by many, including the Negro with the razor,
was as duly bound over under a bond that no one cared
to go, and a few months later was brought to trial, convicted
on two charges, and subsequently sent to the chain
gang for five years.</p>

<p>He should have much of that yet to serve, but he
escaped&mdash;rather, he walked away a few months later,
and has not been intercepted at the time of this writing&mdash;but
this is not our story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FOURTEEN" id="CHAPTER_FOURTEEN"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="center"><i>And Then Came Slim</i></p>


<p>Wintertime had flown, and over all the country,
springtime had blossomed. On one of those beautiful
days, Slim came to the office of Sidney Wyeth. His real
name was V.R. Coleman, but, since he was so tall and
slender, to Wyeth, "Slim" seemed more appropriate,
particularly when the other did not object. This name,
however, was applied sometime later, and not on this
particular day.</p>

<p>In Dixie there are many original characters, and this
has made it the source of humor. Undoubtedly, the
Negro is the background of most of it, and justly plays
the part. Conspicuous among these original characters,
there is a particular class of men who will work from the
time frost falls in November, until the birds sing again
in the last days of March. When the smell of the honeysuckle,
and the buzz of the bee become a part of the day,
they succumb to an inevitable longing to mingle, and
become "human" bees themselves. So, by the time May
has arrived, and spring chickens are large enough to fry,
they go forth to the open, choosing many varied ways&mdash;but
always an easy one&mdash;of living until the leaves begin
to fall again.</p>

<p>Most of these men preach; for, since the beginning of
the present order, this has been the easiest way. No
learning, of course, is required, so long as they can spell
"ligon" and preach "dry bones." Of course, if the
character is a good "feeler," with the magnetism, sufficient
eloquence, and a severe frown with it, he "gets
by" much easier. Conditions, it must be observed, are
changing, even in Dixie. And, it is a fact that a Negro
preacher is beginning to pay for a meal occasionally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were other ways of "gettin' by" as well,
though not nearly so prevalent as preaching. It was in
quest of such a way, no doubt, that Slim came to the
office that day. Wyeth had become acquainted with him
while canvassing during the winter. He was, at that
time, employed in a grocery store as man of much work,
a part of which consisted in driving a little black mule
about the streets, before a wagon in which he delivered
groceries.</p>

<p>They had become friends, and Slim was, in the opinion
of Wyeth, an original and sociable being also. He had
informed Wyeth that music was his line; singing schools
he claimed to have conducted with great success. So,
during the summer and spring months, and some time
into the fall, he carried the title of professor. And it
was as such, that Wyeth welcomed him that day.</p>

<p>"Hello, Professor," he greeted him cordially, arising
from his chair, and grasping the other's hand, with much
ostentation. "Professor" was ushered into a seat, where
he crossed his long legs with much dignity, and gazed
out the window for a moment, without saying other than
the return of the greeting.</p>

<p>As he sat by the window at that time, it was hard to
even <i>fancy</i> his driving a mule in front of a load of groceries.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend," he began, after he had swept the
street below with a careful gaze. "I am glad indeed to
see you, and to find you occupying such a delightful
office." He scanned the office now, with an admiring
gaze, and went on: "You are sure fixed up in great
style, just grand, grand!"</p>

<p>"Oh, fair," Sidney admitted carelessly. "I am, however,
glad you dropped in, for I have been thinking about
you for some time."</p>

<p>"I am honored," said the other, with an elevation of
the eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed Sidney, with a serious and thoughtful
expression, "it has always been my opinion, that a man
with the bearing and dignity you obviously possess,
could be much more in keeping with society, in a position
that would employ such a wealth of ability."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Slim did not make immediate answer to this, for the
simple reason that he was too flushed with vanity by the
words, to do other than color to the roots of his hair, and
swallow.</p>

<p>"When I see a man like you carrying groceries up the
back way of a house, let me tell you, Professor," Wyeth
said flatteringly, "I can't help, in a measure, but feel
despair for our race; but I was told by a very responsible
party, that your health required such an expedient."
Slim was then in the seventh Heaven of vanity, and
looked away to hide the tears of gratitude, he felt toward
the man who had courage sufficiently to admit what he
himself felt. He admired Sidney Wyeth on the spot.</p>

<p>Wyeth went on to say, "Now, for instance, I am in
the book business, which was never better. I have been
anxious to enlist a good man's service." As he said this,
he looked in Slim's direction, and went on: "But I did
not wish to place this matter before you, until a time I
felt you would be in a position to consider it, possibly,
favorably." He paused long enough for his words to
take effect, then continued, "So Professor, I should like
to have you consider this matter with a view to taking
it up."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Mr. Wyeth," his honor began, "I confess
that I have been thinking of that myself." He was silent
a minute, then proceeded again: "My health is improved
to such an extent, that I have, of course, emancipated
myself from a position of drudgery," and here he drew
himself up, with more ostentation than ever. "I shall
be glad to tell you, when it is more convenient, and we
have the time, of my career as a business man back
where I came from. You can, I see, appreciate a man
that is possessed of ability," and he looked down at himself
at this point, before continuing. Directly he said:
"I shall be glad to have you explain this matter in
regard to the book."</p>

<p>"Well," said Wyeth, slowly, "you should have some
idea of the work, since, with your years back in South
Carolina, you were so successful; but more so, since you
have been over a territory I have worked."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"You certainly did fill Brookville with it, I must say,"
he admitted.</p>

<p>Wyeth smiled.</p>

<p>"Wish you hadn't worked that neighborhood, though,"
he said regretfully.</p>

<p>"Others are yet to be worked...."</p>

<p>"But I know everybody in that neighborhood."</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;now."</p>

<p>Slim laughed a low, sorrowful laugh, and then was
thoughtful. Then he inquired: "What commission do you
pay?"</p>

<p>"Forty per cent. Sixty cents the book."</p>

<p>"Do I have to pay for the books before I can have
them to deliver?"</p>

<p>"I can, of course, trust you, Professor," Wyeth replied;
"but the last one I trusted, and who took eighteen copies
out for the purpose of delivery, has not shown up since."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Did he send the books back, or leave them
somewhere?"</p>

<p>"He left them somewhere&mdash;several where's."</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;ah&mdash;got them back?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"But you will?"</p>

<p>"Not likely. The people he left them with paid him
$1.50 a copy therefor, but I have charged that to the
dust, and it has rained since. You think over this proposition
and come back tomorrow morning, and we will
get down to business. Should you decide to take it up,
I shall be glad to have you accompany me an afternoon,
and hear me spiel it."</p>

<p>The following morning, full of book selling, Slim was
on hand. Moreover, he wished to begin that morning,
but, as Sidney had made no arrangement to that end, he
was compelled to wait until the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I used to sell books in South Carolina," he said later,
as he was looking through the book.</p>

<p>"You have had some experience then," commented
Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Wait until I commence. I'll show you a thing or
two."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I have a 'hunch' you'll 'clean up,'" said Wyeth
with feigned admiration.</p>

<p>"You sold a book to somebody I know on Fourteenth
Street....," he smiled.</p>

<p>"I thought you said I sold to many you know. I
think I did," said Wyeth innocently.</p>

<p>"I know this one a little <i>better</i> than the rest," he admitted,
now showing his teeth, despite his effort to keep
his upper lip stiff.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ho, I see now," laughed Wyeth, good naturedly.
After a pause he said:</p>

<p>"Who is she? Come, 'fess up. At what number does
she work?" But at this Slim only laughed, and left his
friend curious.</p>

<p>That afternoon, at two o'clock sharp, they sallied
forth. Going to Dalton street, they entered a cafe conducted
by some people in the last stage of hook-worm
hustle.</p>

<p>"What'll you genamens have?" asked the waitress,
who looked so tired and sleepy.</p>

<p>Sidney scanned the greasy bill-of-fare, while Slim inquired:
"What have you?" As she drawled out the
list, Sidney's ears came attentive to the orders being
given by others.</p>

<p>"Snout."</p>

<p>"Yo's, mistah!"</p>

<p>"Pig tail 'n' swee' taters."</p>

<p>"'N' yo's?"</p>

<p>"Stewed haid."</p>

<p>"Ah wan' some magetti," sang a small boy on a stool,
with papers under his arm.</p>

<p>"Gimme a yeah sanrich," from one with a very loud
mouth.</p>

<p>Slim was very hard to please, as it now appeared, and
was having some difficulty in being satisfied.</p>

<p>"What is your specialty here?"</p>

<p>"Ah don' tole you du' ohdahs already. We has hog
year, 'n' hog snoot, 'n' pig tail, 'n' collap greens, 'n'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give us a pair of feet," interposed Wyeth.</p>

<p>After the meal, they turned into a side street, crossed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
back yard and entered a house from the rear. Ahead, a
flight of steps led up through the basement, to the
kitchen. Up this they went, and rapped on the kitchen
door. It was opened by a woman, presumably the cook.
Wyeth raised his hat, while Slim did likewise; whereupon
she was very much flattered. Said Wyeth: "Yes,
ma'am! How-do-you-do. You will pardon our interrupting
you, but I suppose you are the lady employed
herein," and gazed into the kitchen before him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied embarrassed. "I work here."</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you." Then turning, he revealed
his honor, bending almost to the floor. "This is Professor
Coleman!" Their prospective customer was very profuse
as she accepted the introduction, and then was curious
to know to whom she was indebted. Presently, unable
to withstand the wait, she inquired:</p>

<p>"Are you preachers?"</p>

<p>Wyeth looked at Slim who had his hat rolled up, and
was showing his teeth, then turned back to the lady and
replied that they were not. He then, without further
ado, began his spiel, putting more dynamite into it than
usual, since he wished to make an impression upon Slim
as well.</p>

<p>"I presume from your English, madam, that you are
literarily inclined, in fact, I feel certain you are." He
bestowed upon her a hypnotic smile, which he had
cultivated for the purpose of impression, and then went
on, with eloquence:</p>

<p>"This is <i>The Tempest</i>, a tale of the great northwest, in
which we follow the fortunes of this young man," and
he showed his picture on the frontispiece. In this same
picture, people seldom recognized himself as the hero.
Before long, he had her order, and a half dozen more,
and Slim was enthusiastic. When they were on the
street for a time again, Slim said, with much admiration:</p>

<p>"<i>Man</i>, but you are <i>a</i> salesman! The spiel and look
you turn on these cooks and maids and house girls, and
everybody, is guaranteed to make the dead take notice.
I can never get over laughing when I think of the old
lady back there, the one who said: 'I am not decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
yet as to whether I shall take it,' Then you said, and
as serious as she was: 'Let me decide for you in this,'"
and then he gave up to laughter for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Think you can learn it?" said Sidney.</p>

<p>"I want you to let me take this house," said Slim,
halting before an imposing structure.</p>

<p>"All right," said Wyeth. "I'll wait for you. Don't
get struck on the house girl and stay too long."</p>

<p>Slim disappeared. A moment later, a noise and the
barking of a vicious dog came to Wyeth's ears, accompanied
immediately by a scuffling. A moment later,
Slim emerged from the back way in very much of a
hurry, with a bull dog in close pursuit. When he was
safe outside once more, he looked about him dubiously.
"I don't like this neighborhood!" he said.</p>

<p>"You mean <i>that</i> neighborhood," laughed Wyeth. "Did
you make a sale?"</p>

<p>"Make Hell!" cried Slim, still breathing heavily from
his nervousness. "Talk about making a sale with a
bull dog barking at my heels!" They had, by then,
reached a street that led across town, and they turned
into this. Wyeth took a few orders, but Slim decided to
dispense with further canvassing until the morrow.
Several times, Wyeth tried to steer him into a yard, but
always he observed that his eye wandered around toward
the rear, and since nearly every one kept some kind of a
dog&mdash;the most of which would rather play than anything
else&mdash;it was hard to reconcile Slim.</p>

<p>At last he managed to get him through a gate that
was close to the rear door, and, while he explained his
mission to the cook, Slim gave the house girl a good
talk, but she smiled on him and said: "I purchased one
from the other gentleman already."</p>

<p>This served to relieve him at least, and also encouraged
him to a more concentrated effort later.</p>

<p>When they returned to the office, Slim was again full
of the book business. The next day he went out for himself.
After a few houses had been made, however, he
must have met another "sociable" dog, for, shortly
afterward, Wyeth saw him depart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon, when they met again at the office, he
was surprised to learn that Slim had taken several names,
and was in the highest of spirits. Wyeth was too, but
from other causes. He had taken about eight orders,
when he came into a back yard from an alley. Through
a screen, he caught a glimpse of a girl working in the
kitchen. He approached the house, and presently knocked
on the door. She opened it with an inquiry. He looked
up into her face from where he stood on the ground.
She looked down into his, and blushed as she looked
away. She made an impression, and he was, for a moment,
lost in a maze of delight. Soon he was serious, however,
and said he wished to speak with her on important
business. This was his style. He had observed that
agents, the minute a door was opened, began a spiel
without getting the attention of the prospective customer,
so he made it a practice to get their attention first, and
leave them in doubt until he did, before disclosing his
business. If he failed to do this, he usually went his
way, without letting them know what he was selling.
But, to get back to the girl.</p>

<p>She declared that she was very busy at the time, but
would be glad if he'd come back shortly. "In about an
hour," she advised, as she watched him walk toward the
gate. He went his way with a subtle swimming of the
head.</p>

<p>He passed the next hour mechanically, made several
sales, of which he was hardly aware, and at the end of
the hour, he returned. She was waiting for him. He
smothered his interest, and told her the story in brief.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's fine!" she exclaimed, in an ecstasy of
delight, when he had finished. "When do you deliver?"</p>

<p>"Any time," he replied; "but I have several in this
neighborhood for the first. Could you take yours then?"
As he finished, he looked at her strangely. His thoughts
went back to a place and a person he had almost forgotten. (?)</p>

<p>She looked back at him, smiled, became uneasy, apparently
she did not know how to take him. Then she
asked softly: "Why do you look at me like that?"
And then he came out of it, and replied candidly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," he started to say, "because you
remind me of one I once knew&mdash;and loved." The very
thought of it, however, now pained him. However, he
dismissed these thoughts from his mind, and was normal
again.</p>

<p>She appeared as though she would like to say more on
the subject, but instead she added: "Have you been
selling the book long?"</p>

<p>"Ever since publication," he admitted frankly.</p>

<p>The past lingered with him for some time, but it was
temporarily forgotten, when he had returned to the
office, and noted Slim's success.</p>

<p>"You're there, Professor," he beamed, while the other
assumed an air of modesty.</p>

<p>A few days later&mdash;and he was apparently successful in
the meantime&mdash;Slim said to Wyeth: "I want you to go
with me tomorrow. I've found a 'nest.'"</p>

<p>"A hornet nest?" asked Wyeth humorously. Slim
looked uncomfortable. He had a good memory.</p>

<p>"I'm serious. Out there around the colleges, man, are
some of the finest people you ever met, and rich! They
own homes that will open your eyes."</p>

<p>"M-m. Are <i>these</i> orders from them, or have they told
you they would '<i>think</i>' it over and you could drop in
when you were in the neighborhood again?" Slim's face
fell for a moment, then he said, while Wyeth thought he
detected something.</p>

<p>"These orders are from <i>good</i> people in and around that
neighborhood." He paused for a spell, and resumed, with
a frown: "I have been thinking very seriously, that you
could do much better among the people in their homes,
and wouldn't need to go snoopin' around to the rear.
I must confess, Mr. Wyeth, that I have never been overly
anxious to confine the most of my work to domestics, as
you seem to choose."</p>

<p>Again Sidney smiled, while Slim paused, disconcertedly.</p>

<p>"Now this list I have here, should convince you that
you have simply been over-looking the best people, for
the kitchens. So, if you will go along with me tomorrow,
I will convince you to your own satisfaction."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyeth kept out of going with Slim in different ways,
and 'ere long, the day of Slim's first big delivery came.</p>

<p>Only about forty copies of the book were on hand in
the office, but more were at the freight house, with the
bill-of-lading at the bank, and a sight draft attached for
the cost of the books. Sidney did not have the amount
available to pay it on that day. He reckoned, however,
that the number on hand should have been sufficient,
but Slim didn't think so. He was, moreover, insistent
to a point that moved Sidney to make effort to get the
others out.</p>

<p>"I think we have books sufficient for today's delivery,
Slim," he argued. "And then Monday, we will get those
at the freight office."</p>

<p>"It isn't business, it isn't business. I have taken
these people's orders for this book to be delivered today.
There are fifty. I have promised faithfully to bring the
book this day, and when I was in business, I did a thing
when I promised. So I wish you would get the books
you have at the freight office down here at once, so that
I can fill every order and have no disappointments."</p>

<p>Wyeth looked distressed, but smiled all to himself.
If he had learned anything about selling books to colored
people, and had forty copies to fill fifty orders, he could
figure on having a goodly supply left. But Slim must
have fifty copies, or a book for each order.</p>

<p>The books he had at the freight office would cost a
pretty sum to get, and he did not have the amount convenient.
He went to the bank and borrowed it. Slim
went with him to the freight office to be sure there would
be no failure; he must have fifty books.</p>

<p>When they arrived, Sidney was chagrined to find he
had one dollar less than it took to get them. It was only
fifteen minutes before the office would close, its being
Saturday. Sidney was up against it. Slim was in a
stew. He deluged the other with, "Why didn't you get
them yesterday?" or, "You should have known this
office closes at twelve o'clock today." And in the end he
gave up entirely. Wyeth employed his mind vigorously,
hoping to raise a dollar in fifteen minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's no use," deplored Slim hopelessly. "I will
lose $7 or $8 through your business carelessness." Just
then, Sidney observed a drayman coming toward the
freight house. A thought struck him, and he hailed the
drayman. In a few words, he explained the circumstances,
while the other nodded acquiescence, pulled out
a dollar, and a half hour later, the books were unloaded
at the office.</p>

<p>Slim breathed a sigh of intense relief. He was a business
man, and told Wyeth so.</p>

<p>Wyeth admitted it. "Glad to be affiliated with a
gentleman of your ability, and you know it, Professor."</p>

<p>"You will always find me right up to the point in
business, Mr. Wyeth. That's always been my reputation,
and if you don't believe me, you can go over in
South Carolina, and find out from the people there yourself,"
he said, very serious of demeanor.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Professor. I'll take your word for it."</p>

<p>At one o'clock P.M. Slim was ready. He had a cab
hired for the occasion, and with fifty nice, clean copies,
wrapped deftly at the publishing house before shipment,
he sallied forth.</p>

<p>Wyeth was nodding in the office, when, about ten
o'clock that night, he heard some one coming up the stair.
From the way he halted at intervals, and set something
down, he judged he must be carrying a load.</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>Presently the person reached the landing, and, halting
again, dropped something heavy, then breathed long and
deeply. A moment later, he heard him pick up whatever
it was, and come on toward his door. It was burst
open in a moment, and some one stumbled in behind a
big package.</p>

<p>It was Slim. He dropped the package as soon as he
was inside, with an air of disgust, and fell, apparently
exhausted, into a chair. He was silent, while he got his
breath. When this had become regular, he got up and
moved to the desk, where he figured for some time.
Wyeth remained silent, but quietly expectant. It came
presently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Liars! Dirty liars! Stinking, low down, dirty lying
niggas. Damn all of them, damn them!"</p>

<p>Wyeth was still silent. Slim looked about himself
wearily, and then did some more figuring. Presently
Wyeth heard him again.</p>

<p>"Lying nigga's, o'nry nigga's, dog-gone the bunch!"</p>

<p>Wyeth was impatient. He wanted to ask very innocently
what the matter was. Suddenly he saw Slim
looking at him savagely. Wyeth made an effort to look
innocent, and not burst out laughing. After awhile he
heard Slim again.</p>

<p>"I'm done! I'm through selling books to Negroes
<i>now</i>!" He then arose, and strode back and forth across
the room in a terrible temper.</p>

<p>Wyeth started to say: "You mean you are through
getting orders." But he waited.</p>

<p>"The first old nigga I come up to, looked up when he
saw me, and then just laffed, 'ke-ha!' Then, when I
held the book toward him, he said: 'Yu' betta' gwan
'way frum heh wi' dat book!' And then just laffed
again, like it was something so funny. I got mad right
then, but kept my temper and said:</p>

<p>"'What's the matter with you! Didn't you order this
book from me two weeks ago?'" He paused at this stage,
and looked at Wyeth again with a savage glare. "But
that old devil just kept on laffing like a vaudeville show
was before him, instead of me with the book he had
ordered, and which he told me to be sure, <i>sure</i> to bring
today. My nigga was rising now; but just then I heard
a little half-naked kid: 'Uh! Misteh! 'oo might's well
ferget it. 'Cause th' ole man there,' pointing to the old
sinner, 'orders sumpin' from eve' agent what comes
'long; puvidin' i' do'n cos' nuthin' t' give th' odah.'
And all the time that old coon was just laffing, 'ke-ha!'"
He gave Wyeth another glare, and went on:</p>

<p>"The next one I come onto looked at the book as
though it was something dangerous. And then he squints
up at me&mdash;I think he must have been near-sighted&mdash;and
says: 'Sah, I decided since I give you that odah, that I
wa'n't go'n' take th' book.' When he saw my eyes, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
could see I was mad enough to kill him on the spot.
He saw danger in them too, because, near-sighted or not,
he began edging away, but again I held back my nigga
and says: 'What in Hell you mean by making up your
mind like that!'"</p>

<p>"He must have been drinking Sparrow Gin when he
gave you that order," suggested Wyeth, with a twinkle
of the eye.</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Slim, listening.</p>

<p>"I'd advise you to take along a little corn liquor the
next time you go to deliver; pour a little juice into
them; get them drunk. They'll take their books then."</p>

<p>Slim kicked a piece of paper on the floor before him
viciously, and said: "I'll take along a club and knock
their lying heads off their shoulders, 's what I'll do."</p>

<p>"Did you have enough books?" inquired Wyeth,
ignoring the big package Slim had brought in.</p>

<p>"You seem possessed with no sympathy, Mr. Wyeth,"
he complained, and then grew thoughtful. Presently,
seeming anxious to tell more of his experiences, he went
on. "One woman I had an order from, when I knocked
on the door, she opened it and said: 'I'm so sorry, but
my husband won't let me take that book,' and then she
handed me a nickel, saying, 'so I'm going to give you
this for your trouble.' I could not, of course, be ugly,
as much as I felt like it, but I had to say something.
So I inquired, as kind as I could under the circumstances,
'What am I to do with this?' She looked distressed at
first, then brightened with a thought, and replied, as
though she were doing something wonderful: 'Why, you
can use it for car fare. You won't have to walk back.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Shoo Fly</i>"</p>


<p>Wyeth had not been able, as yet, to awaken much
literary interest among his people in the south, but he
had a great many agents working all over the north. Of
those he had secured in Dixie, he was deluged with complaints
to the effect that so many people failed to take
the books they ordered; so, he began shipping only
fifteen when an agent sent in an order for thirty books.
This worked better, and the office was not the recipient
of so many complaints thereafter.</p>

<p>As for Slim, he went with the cook on Fourteenth
Street, ate two meals there out of every three, and canvassed
whenever he felt so disposed. He had some cards
made, only one hundred. Four hundred more would
have cost but little additional. He handed them about,
advertising that he would conduct a singing class at his
residence, beginning any time any one wished lessons.
He was successful in delivering more books, when he
returned to work among the domestics, but not so many
that, at any time afterwards, was Wyeth put to such
strenuous efforts to secure books, in order that he might
have one for every customer.</p>

<p>When the colleges had closed for vacation, Wyeth
hired the matron to work in the office, and, upon finding
her very interesting, Slim became more in evidence about
the office.</p>

<p>Just about this time, the auditorium was completed
which was begun two years before, by the lodge of which
B.J. Dickson was the secretary. It was decided to ask
the head of Tuscola, the great Negro educator, to speak
at the dedication services. He was secured, and this fact
caused thousands to gather for the occasion. It gave
Wyeth an opportunity to hear the noted Negro for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
second time in his life, the first being twelve years before,
in Chicago.</p>

<p>The day came at last. It rained in the forenoon, but
was calm and clear in the afternoon. The night was fit,
and the mammoth place was filled to overflowing, while
thousands, unable to gain admittance, loafed outside,
where they were entertained by a band, that served to
keep them quiet. For Dickson, fully acquainted with
his own race, was aware that they would disturb the
speaker, if some diversion was not resorted to, for their
amusement.</p>

<p>The speaker looked very tired and worn, and Wyeth
felt a pang at his heart when he saw him. His years of
service were beginning to tell upon him. He had returned
recently from the west, where he had gone for the purpose
of raising $150,000 for his school, and had, as he did in
everything else, succeeded beyond requirements. He
was not only an educator, but a practical business man
as well. To one who sat near him, Sidney Wyeth said
that evening: "And no one of these odd ten millions is
competent, in the public's favor, to take that old man's
place, when eventually he will be called." The other
sighed as he made reply: "There are many, though, who
feel that they and not he should be in the confidence of
the world, and have wasted themselves in uselessness
and inactivity, as a result of their imagination." The
speaker's eyes, at the distance Wyeth saw them, seemed
dazed, and his voice was strained; but he did not soon
forget the words he spoke to those black people, in
dedication of an instant that had been inspired by his
work. B.J. Dickson came in for a worthy praise, which
Wyeth knew he justly deserved.</p>

<p>It was some two weeks afterwards, that a convention
was held, which brought together a class of men, who
were largely leaders of this race. They were the doctors,
the dentists, the pharmacists, and all men connected with
physical and surgical dispensation; and they came from
two adjoining states also. Sidney Wyeth had, therefore,
opportunity to see his own people from a professional
point of view, and was cheered to observe the most refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
set of men of his own kin, that he had ever seen. Dickson
thought so too, and wrote as much in <i>The Independent</i>,
the following week; but he wrote of something else connected
with the same men, and served to show Sidney
Wyeth something he did not know, could not have
believed; but Dickson made it plain to the thousands of
readers of <i>The Independent</i>, of which Wyeth was a constant
reader.</p>

<p>In the building, conspicuously located on the best
corner, was a drug store, acknowledged to be the finest
drug store operated by black people in the south. The
new building included a street front on another side
street, the drug store and many other trades on the
ground space, with a row of offices to the number of
about twenty-five, especially fitted for physicians and
dentists. All these encircled the auditorium, and were
regarded as the most artistic arrangement in the building.
Moreover, this was advantageous in many ways. At all
events, it happened to be convenient for the men gathered
on the occasion referred to. In addition to being used as
a gathering place, this auditorium could be conveniently
cleared for the purpose of dancing, and was employed for
that purpose, on the night the convention closed. And
this was what B.J. Dickson wrote in the following week's
issue of <i>The Independent</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"COLOR LINE DRAWN AT THE PHYSICIAN'S BALL</p>

<p>"Last week there was held in Attalia, the annual convention
of the Tri-State Medical Association, as was
stated in last week's issue of <i>The Independent</i>. Never
before has this city been graced by a more refined, and
obviously intelligent class of colored men. From all
over the state, and the two states adjoining, which are
members of the league, came physicians, surgeons, dentists
and pharmacists, representing the highest body of
men in the Negro race. They were entertained in sumptuous
splendor, by the same profession of men in Attalia.
This was facilitated by the fact, that the new buildings
and the auditorium were employed for the occasion, and
the members were not compelled, as they had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the past, to house their social function in some old
deserted hall, in a deserted part of the city.</p>

<p>"It is, therefore, with deep regret, that we are called, by
the bond of common sense and race appreciation, to
mention a narrowness that pervaded this great occasion.</p>

<p>"It may be recalled, when the leader of our race spoke
at the dedication, a few weeks past, that, on the committee
were numerous doctors, some of them successful
leaders, and some who were not. Yet it is and always
has been the custom of our people, to honor these men
in the best way we can, for we have long since come to
appreciate that they are a part, and an important part
of this new dispensation. Surely it is in order and keeping
with the uplift of black people, to help men whose training
has fitted them for such an important place. That,
perhaps, is why their conduct of last week has constrained
us to make this mention.</p>

<p>"They drew the color line. Plainly, and irrevocably.
At the ball, at the stag party, and during the entire
proceedings of the convention. Not a black person save
one&mdash;the wife of one of the local physicians who married
her for money&mdash;was invited. Such an example shocks us,
so to speak. It seems incredible, in view of the condition
of our race, both morally and mentally. And still,
though we have forced our pen to ignore it, it has been,
and is shown, right along. At the ball, not only was the
color line drawn, but a white orchestra gave the music.
Imagine such a spectacle! In the bourbon and always
democratic south, our people hiring a white orchestra,
at a fabulous sum; for, since long before we were free,
Negroes have made music for the richest white people
to dance by.</p>

<p>"Surely the old order changeth!</p>

<p>"Negro doctors live by the patronage of their race,
positively; the white people would not hire one to doctor
a dog. In the dark ages, when it was felt that a Negro
was incompetent for anything else but to act as a slave,
some excuse could be given for Negroes to hire white
doctors. But today, all race loving people give their
practice to their own, except those who are nearly white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and wish they were. But more than half of those at the
ball have white doctors, and wouldn't hire one of those
with whom they danced. But Negro doctors expect
Negro practice, and deplore it terribly when Negroes hire
white physicians! On the heels of this, too, they say
"Shoo fly!" to Negro musicians who are competent to
play for the whites, but not for Negro doctors. Like
everything else that relates to our people&mdash;except their
money&mdash;our professionals wrinkle their faces, and conclude
without trial, that no Negro orchestra is properly
trained to play for their balls; and Negroes who conduct
newspapers do not know enough to write a part of
what they read; books of Negro authors are not read
by them, because they don't know enough&mdash;in the minds
of these hypocrites&mdash;and so it goes in everything. They
could not have held their convention in the white auditorium,
even if permitted to, because that would have
cost more than they were able to pay.</p>

<p>"Now, if Negro orchestras are incompetent as musicians
and are, therefore, relegated to the rear, and a white
orchestra is hired to give music, and if Negroes as authors
and editors, do not know enough to write a part of what
they should read, and, moreover, if Negroes who happen
not to be the scion of some white man, and, therefore,
possessed of a yellow face, are not good enough to mingle
and associate with them, then the Negro doctors are not
fit to 'kill' us. Why not let the white man do this?
Admitting that the white orchestra and the white editor
and author have more advantages than do the Negroes
in the same vocation, is it not credible that the same
applies in regard to the doctors? Is it not to be appreciated
that, while the white man, often and mostly
the son of a rich parent, is taking a post-graduate course
abroad, the poor Negro boy is slinging hash in a cheap
hotel&mdash;most of the best ones hire white help now&mdash;to get
the wherewith to go back and finish school?</p>

<p>"Oh, we have thought this brave in our people these
many years, and our very hearts and souls and sympathies
have been with them in this great effort!</p>

<p>"And we are repaid in these terms!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"The black-skinned people who pay them their hard-earned
money, that we might have a representative set
of men as our leaders, have been scorned for their pains!</p>

<p>"They, the doctors, set up what they silently look upon
as society, "blue-veined people." How they must deplore
that they are colored, in a literal sense! "We are the
best people!" they cry. The insurance companies,
started and led to their present position of success by
black men, use every means, subtle and otherwise, to
throw business to these men. Likewise do the lodges.
And with all that, not more than a dozen or so are making
a decent living in Attalia. We are still very poor people.
Yet when society comes before us, the black ones are not
good enough to play for. We must close. It makes us
sick!"</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SIXTEEN" id="CHAPTER_SIXTEEN"></a>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>Why Do You Look At Me So Strangely?</i>"</p>


<p>The first books came, and among the many orders to
be delivered, was one for the girl who had reminded
Wyeth of a person who now belonged to a closed chapter
of his life. He carried her the book.</p>

<p>"My madam has not paid me yet," she said regretfully,
"but if you can bring it back next week, I will be
delighted to take it."</p>

<p>He did so, and she was as good as her word. "I hope
I shall enjoy it," she said, as she paid him.</p>

<p>"I hope so too," said he. "Practically all I have sold
to told me that they liked it," he added. He looked at
her, and while he was not aware of it, in that moment he
had an insane desire. The past and the one connected
with it, rose for one brief second before him, as he had
known it. She noted the strange look, and was embarrassed.
Presently she recovered from the effect it had,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so strangely?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied, non-committally.</p>

<p>She did not understand it, but blushed as she said:
"You are indeed a strange person.... I have thought
about it more than once, since you were here and took
my order. Do you look at all your lady customers like
that?" She looked full into his eyes as she said this,
but what she saw there made her hastily retract.</p>

<p>"I was only joking. You are singular&mdash;strange,
and&mdash;I do not know what to think of you; but you are
more than an ordinary agent for the book. I'm sure of
that." He remained silent. She looked keenly at the
picture, and then at him. A small mustache and a
different style in the trimming of his hair; but she inquired
suddenly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you write this book? The picture resembles
you." He looked innocent and said:</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," she insisted. '"Then you wrote it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed," he lied, earnestly.</p>

<p>She appeared dubious, and then said, thoughtfully:
"Maybe you have some private reasons for not wishing
to be identified as the author, but I feel positive that
you are." She smiled appreciatively for a moment, as
she surveyed him carefully. "I think you must be smart
and know a great deal, to be able to write such a big
book. I shall always recall with pleasure, that I had the
honor&mdash;though he did not acknowledge the fact&mdash;of
meeting a real author." She extended her hand, which
he took, as she said: "I am glad to have met you; and
if you write another book, please try to remember that
I would like to have a copy of it. Goodbye."</p>

<p>Slim was lolling in the office when Sidney returned.
Mrs. Lautier, the clerk and ex-matron, found him very
much to her humor, as did Sidney, and he was appreciated
in the capacity of mirth.</p>

<p>"Well," he said cheerfully, "I'm doing a little better
now. Delivered six copies today," and almost took
Wyeth's breath away by handing him $5.40.</p>

<p>"Say," he cried suddenly, when they had settled up.
"I happened upon something today in which I am deeply
interested, and have been very anxious to tell you." He
lowered his voice to a whisper, while Sidney looked
surprised, but listened.</p>

<p>"It's a grocery stock that can be bought at a bargain."</p>

<p>"Well?..."</p>

<p>"A chance for you and me to get in right...."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We'll buy it?"</p>

<p>"But I am not in the grocery business. Books!"</p>

<p>"But you are out to make money?"</p>

<p>"I don't gather what you want or expect me to do."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll explain." He seated himself comfortably,
and then went on in that low tone of voice. "A fellow
is in partnership with another who is up against it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
cash, and offers to sell his share, which is a half interest,
at a bargain." He paused again briefly, and then went
on. "I, as you know, having recently quit working in a
grocery, naturally know all about the conducting of one."</p>

<p>Wyeth nodded understandingly, and remained silent
and patient.</p>

<p>"I see in this thing the chance I have been waiting for,
and am ready to consider it favorably. Big money is to
be made, can be made out of it for me, and I can, at the
same time and in the same enterprise, become a man of
affairs."</p>

<p>"M-m," breathed his listener, "How do you propose
to conduct it?"</p>

<p>"Well," artfully, "first, it should, of course, be incorporated.
And then a competent manager and treasurer
are necessary."</p>

<p>"M-m. Do you propose to increase the present stock?"</p>

<p>"Not at once. I think the stock as it stands at the
present, is quite sufficient to care for the trade which, I
have observed, is good."</p>

<p>"M-m."</p>

<p>"I thought as a favor, I would tell you and give you a
chance. You could put in an equal share along with
myself, which would give you a fourth interest, and you
could become vice president."</p>

<p>"I suppose you will, of course, quit selling books,
should you take over the affairs of this&mdash;er&mdash;corporation?"
said Wyeth, with well feigned regret.</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, meditatively; "I have not
fully decided as yet. It depends largely upon whether
you can be brought to see the great advantage you would
gain by coming in."</p>

<p>"But what little I represent&mdash;which surely isn't
much&mdash;is tied up in the book business. How much will
this thing cost?" Slim winked wisely, held his head low,
and whispered it into his ear.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars."</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," said Wyeth, feigning seriousness.</p>

<p>The next day, Slim had forgotten all about the grocery
business, but tore into the office in an ecstasy of delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and secrecy. He had discovered something else. It was
a soda fountain, rather, it was some old fixtures. When
the drug store below had been moved into the new
building, they had stored their old fixtures in an empty
store room near. The same had been vacant for ten
years, but Slim happened by, and saw a grand opportunity
at a glance.</p>

<p>He told this to Sidney, with much feeling. "It's the
greatest proposition of a decade! We can buy those
fixtures for a song, rent the place they are in cheap,
move the office up there, and conduct a book store and
soda fountain in connection." His eyes opened wide, as
he revealed the magnitude of the proposition.</p>

<p>"Can't do it, Slim. It's too big. Guess I'll have to
stick to books." The other took on a disappointed
expression.</p>

<p>"It's the chance of a life time," he said, with plain
regret, and continued to look the part. "I thought you
were down here to make money, and when I go out and
find something that's an Eldorado, I cannot enlist you.
You are making a serious mistake, and will regret it
some day."</p>

<p>That was all for that day, but the next day he was
mysterious. He didn't, however, "put" Wyeth next to
this, but, on the quiet, he met others on the street below,
where, at some length, they discussed a restaurant and
hotel business, to be duly incorporated, and an office and
a management to be appointed. Mrs. Lautier made
known to Wyeth the inner secrets of this the next day.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly disappointed in you, Mr. Wyeth," said
Slim, one day soon after, very grievously.</p>

<p>"How's that, Professor?" inquired the other, with
assumed concern.</p>

<p>"You never seem to consider seriously, the many good
propositions I have discovered, and have offered to you
for investment."</p>

<p>"Do you yourself?"</p>

<p>"I could make a bunch of money if you would come
in," he repeated artfully, but ignored the direct question.</p>

<p>The next day, he was more artful than ever. He was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
indeed, full of another proposition. He smiled as he told
his friend.</p>

<p>"I'm going to marry that woman out there," he said,
low and confidentially.</p>

<p>"On Fourteenth?" the other echoed cheerfully, returning
a sincere smile. "That's where you're a man.
That'll sure be dandy. When?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not yet a-while, not until I get a divorce from
the last one."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;then. M-m. So you've been married already,
rather, you are."</p>

<p>"I have never told you much of my past life, except
from a business point, have I?" He smiled naively, and,
taking a chair, he became seated, placed his feet in the
window, and proceeded to narrate a part of his past.</p>

<p>"I've been married twice," he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, twice...."</p>

<p>"Yes. My first wife died. We lived on a farm in
South Carolina, and were as happy a couple as you ever
knew. I owned a two-horse farm, and raised plenty of
cotton and corn and some hogs, while my wife raised
plenty of chickens and garden truck. We had two boys,
whom I kept in school in town during the winter. And
then, after my crops were laid by, my wife looked after
the place, while I went out and sold song books and
pictures, and preached."</p>

<p>"Then you're a preacher, too," said Wyeth, when he
paused a moment. "I didn't think you were a preacher,"
he continued, looking him over.</p>

<p>"Well, not altogether. I preach sometimes, but not
much since I married the last woman."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, that woman almost made me
lose my religion, she was such a devil."</p>

<p>Wyeth was silent, but attentive. Slim went on.</p>

<p>"Didn't you meet my brother? He was here not long
ago. I had him up here in the office. You might have
seen him about the building here. You could not have
mistaken him for any one else, if you had seen him."</p>

<p>"Does he look like you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord, no!" Slim exclaimed, with a laugh. "Not at
all. And you would not have believed it; but ten years
ago he was as spare as I am. Then he went to preaching,
and since then he has become the fattest thing you ever
saw."</p>

<p>Wyeth smiled naively. Coleman proceeded with his
interrupted narrative.</p>

<p>"Well, getting back to that <i>woman</i>; I married her
four months after my first wife died, and took her to
live in the same house. We got along less than three
weeks in peace. Then things began to warm up. She
was a devil, if there ever was one on top of the earth,
but I persisted faithfully." His appearance was now very
pious. "The first big row we had was on Sunday. It
was in the morning, and I, with my Bible under my arm,
was starting to church. She didn't want to go that day,
and had tried to keep me from going; but I always led
the prayer, and preached during the pastor's absence,
so, as I was saying, I was starting for church. When
I passed a room in which she had enclosed herself to
pout, she suddenly opened it, and hit me in the side with
a big rock. If it had not struck the Bible, I think I
would have been hurt seriously; but it hit the book and
my arm, and rolled upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Well, after that, the devil was to pay. She kept me
in Hell and hot water, and we got along like a cat and
a dog. Each day, from sunrise until long after it had set,
I asked Jesus whether I could hold out to the end. I had
declared to his Holy Name, that I had taken that woman
to live with for better or for worse; but surely I was
getting the worst of it. And then, at last, it came to
the point when it was beyond human endurance. She
took to shooting at me for the fun of it."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Wyeth. "You don't mean
to say that she shot at you!"</p>

<p>"No," he replied calmly, "she didn't <i>shoot</i> at me;
she <i>shot</i> at me, and not once, but any old time she felt
like it, which was more than once, by many, many
times," he soliloquized, grimly.</p>

<p>"Good night!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; she shot at me as though it were no more than
throwing hot water on a bunch of rats."</p>

<p>"Save me Jesus!"</p>

<p>"Then one day I shot at her."</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shot at her and tried to hit, but I am thankful
the good Lord was with us both against ourselves, I
missed. I think I was too much excited."</p>

<p>"Deliver me!"</p>

<p>"It was a few days after we had had a big row for
sure, and she had declared she would kill me."</p>

<p>Wyeth looked helpless. Slim smiled grimly, and
went on:</p>

<p>"It was about my first wife. I had an enlarged picture
of her that hung on the wall, and this devil had been
eyeing it with apparent disfavor. That day, she stood
directly under it, looking up at it with a double ax concealed
in her skirt. I knew she had the ax, and watched
her. I swore to myself that the day of Pentecost had
come. If she touched my dead wife's picture, I would
kill her on the spot."</p>

<p>"Be merciful, Coleman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, in a terrible voice. "I would
have done so too, you can bet your last dollar on that.</p>

<p>"She kept looking up at it, and muttering in a low
tone. I heard her say: 'I've a notion to tear you to
pieces!' I decided that I would tell her, and in so doing
give her one chance, a last chance to continue life in
this world. So I said: 'Woman, woman, if you touch
that picture, get ready to die, for, just as sure as I'm a
nigga, I'm going to put your lights out!' Those were
terrible days, terrible days," he sighed wearily, and for
the first time since Wyeth had known him, he felt a
pang of sorrow for him. He was serious. Presently he
resumed:</p>

<p>"She went out without a word&mdash;she was always
dangerous when she said nothing&mdash;and returned presently,
with a brand new, great big pistol, and, without a word
she began shooting. She and I then had it. She with
the gun and me a-running, while she pulled the trigger,
and run me all over that farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"After this, I armed myself and got ready. I took the
children to my mother, sold off the stock and everything
else but the furniture. I asked the Lord to spare my
life, and not let one of those bullets from that gun she
always carried, push daylight through me, and I would
try to fulfill my promise, God's will be done. I offered
her half if she wanted to quit, but she didn't. No, after
she had shot at me and scared me out of my wits, she
was ready for me to take her in my arms.</p>

<p>"For awhile, things became a little better, but suddenly
she went off half-cock, and pulled the trigger of that big
gun on me again. Then she got her surprise. I had a
gun too. She had a Smith and Wesson, and I had a left-hand
Wheeler. 'Ki-doi! Ki-doi!' my old gun barked,
and the magazine would whirl around cleverly, automatically.
She stood frozen to the spot for a minute,
then, taking fright, she dropped hers, and flew with me
right after her, shooting that old cannon at every leap.
Across the country we went. I loaded and emptied it a
half dozen times, and shot away twenty-five shells. I
shot at everything in sight!</p>

<p>"After that, I finished selling out and went to Arkansas,
where I was getting along all right, until I was fool
enough to let her come to me. Again we got along very
well for a time, but she got to cocking her pistol where
and when I could hear it, so I set out again. Just lately
she came to Brookville, and went to raising cain, trying
to force me to take care of her. So, as you see, she made
me quit there, and thus you see me."</p>

<p>For a long time, both were silent. The noise outside
came to their ears, clearly and distinctly, while the
ticking of the clock seemed louder than ever before.
Presently, Sidney, to relieve his own emotions, arose
from his chair and went outside.</p>

<p>Slim spoke of marrying the woman on Fourteenth
street, every day for the next week. One morning he
came in, his face beaming all over with smiles, and
pleasant anticipation was plainly evident.</p>

<p>"Well," he began, "we talked it over last night, and
she thinks it will be all right. So I want you to write a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
letter to my brother who owes me some money, and tell
him I must have it, since I am engaged to be married,
and must have it to use in paying for my divorce."</p>

<p>Wyeth did so.</p>

<p>"That's fine," he cried gratefully, when it was handed
to him. "You certainly can say a whole lot in a few
words."</p>

<p>"When I get married to this woman, I think I will
have a mate like my first one," said Coleman. Wyeth
tendered his sympathy.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, as one put to a task he would like to
avoid, "I must get around, and see a lawyer about a
divorce." He was thoughtful for a moment, and then
resumed: "Wonder what they charge for divorces in
this town?"</p>

<p>"Depends upon the attorney and the case," said
Wyeth. "I think twenty-five dollars is the usual fee, or
amount of cost." Slim hesitated thoughtfully, and then
said:</p>

<p>"I'll go down here and see this nigga lawyer. He
ought to be willing to get one cheaper than a white
lawyer. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>He went out. About a half hour later he returned,
looking downcast and sullen. He was silent for some
minutes, and then said, as if addressing himself: "That
nigga's crazy."</p>

<p>"Who's crazy?" Sidney inquired, looking up.</p>

<p>"That nigga lawyer."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that out?"</p>

<p>"I went in there, and spoke to him in regard to the
divorce, and what do you think he wants for getting
me one?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars! What do you think of that for highway
robbery?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps your case is a bit more complicated than
the average, and, therefore, justifies a larger fee," Wyeth
suggested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw, that what he said, too, but he's a blood sucker.
He can't gouge me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Wyeth in an off-hand manner, "you
won't quibble on a matter of twenty-five dollars additional,
when you are getting a good wife. Consider
that as a treasure."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care. If she's willing to pay half, I'll
give the sucker fifty." Wyeth bestowed a terrible look
upon him, whereupon Slim withered:</p>

<p>"Well, she'd be getting as much as I. So what's the
difference?" he tried to argue. Wyeth continued to
glare at him.</p>

<p>"The idea!" he declared presently, with undisguised
contempt. "To wish a woman to pay for your release
from another! I'm too shocked to say how ashamed I
am of you!"</p>

<p>Slim laughed sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars for a pair of legs like you! If I
were a woman, I wouldn't give twenty-five cents for you
as you sit there now," Wyeth added, with subdued mirth.</p>

<p>The next day, his atmosphere had changed perceptibly.
He was in an ugly humor. Presently he gave words to
its cause.</p>

<p>"That nigga woman's fooling me, and I know it."</p>

<p>"What's the stew today?"</p>

<p>"She's got another nigga a-hangin' around her. I've
been suspicioning it for some time."</p>

<p>"You're the limit."</p>

<p>"I gave her a ballin' out last night about it too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lautier came in at this moment, and that was the
end of it for awhile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>I'll Never be Anything But a Vagabond</i>"</p>


<p>Sidney Wyeth had about filled Attalia with <i>The
Tempest</i> by this time, and had anticipated going to
another city almost as large, about one hundred seventy
miles west. He made known the fact to Slim, and suggested
that he might leave him in charge of the office, if
he did so. As a precaution, or rather, to get some idea
of his ability to dictate letters, he had him compose a
few. When the typist handed them to him to be read,
and he had done so, he decided to allow him to continue
his canvass, and to hire some one more proficient.</p>

<p>"Say," he cried the next day. "I've been thinking it
over, and maybe I'll be going along with you."</p>

<p>"That so? Well, I do not see any reason in particular
why you should not go."</p>

<p>"There's only one reason," he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. King."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; that's so. When's the wedding going to
be?"</p>

<p>He glared at Wyeth a second, and then exclaimed
doggedly: "I'm not going to marry. I wouldn't marry
the best woman in the world."</p>

<p>"From what you have told me, it seems that you <i>did</i>
marry the worst," laughed the other.</p>

<p>"I'll stay single henceforth, and be safe," he growled,
and busied himself through some papers.</p>

<p>"Stay single, eh! And let the nice lady go without a
husband. It's incredible that you can be so regardless!"</p>

<p>"I do not care to discuss marrying today," he muttered.
"I've something better. It's a business proposition."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I see. What is it this time? Going to buy the

<p>"Oh, you needn't try to kid me. Besides I have not
asked you to come in, though if you did, you could pick
up some big, quick money, if you were of a mind to be
serious."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if it doesn't take more than a million, I
might be brought to consider it," Wyeth smiled, with
assumed seriousness.</p>

<p>"I can see you laffing in your sleeve, so I don't tell
you anything, you see!" He ended it angrily, and left
the office.</p>

<p>It was too good though to keep to himself, so he told
Mrs. Lautier, who in turn told it to Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Coleman had me write to Ames today, in regard
to some song books, which he says he used to sell lots of,"
she said, when it was convenient.</p>

<p>Wyeth grunted.</p>

<p>"He is very much provoked at the way you treat him.
He says, if you would go in with him, you and he could
both make lots of money; but that you only laugh in
your sleeve at everything he proposes," she went on,
replete with gossip.</p>

<p>"He proposes many things," said Wyeth.</p>

<p>She giggled.</p>

<p>"He's going out to Liberty Street Baptist Church to
sing and sell them Sunday, providing he gets them in
time." She typed a few letters, and then said:</p>

<p>"He says he would like to go to Effingham with you
and sell books, but that you want too much for it. That
the book is too high, and you want to make too much.
He says the book ought to sell for a dollar, and he should
be paid seventy-five cents for selling it."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't make a living selling it then," retorted
Wyeth, somewhat impatiently. Then he thought of Mrs.
King, who fed him most of the time.</p>

<p>The following Monday, Wyeth thought he had fallen
heir to a fortune. He passed him in the hallway, with
head high, and as serious as zero.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lautier imparted the reason for it, when Sidney
had taken out the letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Coleman had a great day yesterday, so he informed
me," she smiled. "He said you should have
been out to Liberty Street Baptist Church, and heard
him sing and sell song books afterwards. He said you
were not a Christian, however, which made it bad."</p>

<p>"How many song books did he sell, and what did he
receive a copy for them?"</p>

<p>"I think six, and he received fifteen cents apiece,"
she replied. He entered at this moment, his face wreathed
in triumphant smiles.</p>

<p>"Well, my doubting friend, if you would have taken
the trouble to come out to Liberty Street Baptist Church
yesterday, I think you would have been convinced that
I am something of a salesman after all."</p>

<p>"I've just been told that you 'mopped' up," said
Wyeth, heartily. Slim swelled perceptibly. He seated
himself, crossed his legs, and resumed:</p>

<p>"When I used to live in South Carolina, I was considered
one of the best salesman in the country."</p>

<p>"You must have been a great man in South Carolina,"
said Wyeth. Slim observed him a moment sharply.
Presently he went on:</p>

<p>"I would go to the camp meetings and festivals, sing
a few songs, get the people warmed up with a good
sermon, and then sell hundreds of song books in the end."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" from Sidney.</p>

<p>"I am going to the HNRTYU convention at Timberdale
Thursday, and I thought you'd like to go along,"
he said, artfully.</p>

<p>"Couldn't very well do it, unless you got them to hold
the convention over until next week."</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> not take me seriously, regardless of my
success," he complained. "Now yesterday I sold a pile
of song books, and today I am sending the man his share
of the money. I could do you some good with the book
you are general agent for, if you would increase my
commission to seventy-five cents a copy, and lower the
price to a dollar."</p>

<p>"If you wrote the publishers, they might give you the
books free of charge, providing you agreed to pay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
freight on arrival, and not let the railroad company come
back on them later for it," soliloquized Sidney.</p>

<p>He went to Timberdale the next day, and the office
saw no more of him for a week.</p>

<p>"When will Mr. Coleman return?" Mrs. Lautier would
inquire every day. "I certainly do miss him."</p>

<p>"He's our mascot, our jest. I miss him also," said
Sidney, and they both spoke of him at some length.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lautier was also a sociable person about the
office, Sidney was coming to appreciate more each day.
She was from New Orleans, and a creole. She had personality,
and a way that won all who were near her.
She was slender and very dark, and, although only
thirty-nine, was almost white-haired, which contrasted
beautifully with her dark skin. Her eyes were small and
bead-like, while she was affectionate by nature. Her
make-up was in keeping with the position she held as
matron at one of the local Negro colleges. When she
spoke, her voice struck the ear musically. She was a
widow.</p>

<p>"Why have you never remarried, Mrs. Lautier?"
Wyeth ventured, one day. She colored unseen for a
moment, before she answered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's a reason."</p>

<p>"What reason? You are charming&mdash;very charming,
I think," said he earnestly, although he smiled.</p>

<p>She hid her face. For a woman of her age, she was
most extraordinary. "I have been told that creole
people have a most frightful temper," pursued Wyeth,
enjoying her manner. "Is that quite true?"</p>

<p>"Yes," She admitted, surveying him now.</p>

<p>"And do you happen to be endowed with such an
asset, also?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be a creole if I were not," she advised,
still smiling.</p>

<p>"That's too bad," said he, a trifle sadly. "You seem
too kind and sweet of manner, to be liable to those
angry, wild fits they tell me they have."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will see New Orleans while you are in
the south, and the creoles; and then, you can be better
prepared to understand them in the future," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I will," he said, after some thinking. "Yes,
perhaps I will. I had not thought of it before."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Mr. Coleman will be back tomorrow," cried Mrs.
Lautier, entering the office a day or so later. "I received
a postal from him announcing the fact, so we will not be
so lonesome now."</p>

<p>"I am anxious to see what he did in Timberdale. I
guess he succeeded in turning it upside down, and covering
the whole town with song books."</p>

<p>The next morning, early, he was back. He entered the
office and sat around in silence, seeming to be in an
introspective mood. Wyeth waited for what he knew
would eventually come. It did not as early as it usually
did, in fact, he sighed wearily and looked so peculiar,
until Wyeth, to break the impatience he was laboring
under, presently turned his gaze upon him, and said:
"Well, I see you are back...." The other sat up and
looked about him suddenly, as though awakened from a
trance.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have more money now than you can
conveniently use for a while," Wyeth tested. "Made a
bunch in Timberdale?"</p>

<p>"Like Hell!" spat the other grumblingly. "Lucky to
be back here alive."</p>

<p>"M-m! What did you run up against? A freight
train, or the madam?"</p>

<p>"I left the day she arrived," he said in a heavy tone,
then added, after a pause: "They've been lynching and
driving nigga's out of that town this week, so the convention
was a fizzle."</p>

<p>"I suppose you sold out before they got after you?
How many song books did you sell?"</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you the white people was raising Hell,
and a-killing and burning Negroes like barbecue out
there!" he exclaimed impatiently. "I never sold any
song books, but I sold one copy of <i>The Tempest</i>."</p>

<p>"How many song books of the amount you received
have you still on hand?"</p>

<p>"All but six."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you had sold them all but a dozen when
you left for Timberdale."</p>

<p>"Aw, that old nigga that I left them with, and who
claimed he could sell them at his church and more,
slipped them back into my room while I was away. He
didn't sell any."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be getting back into your old-time
selling form very rapidly," suggested Wyeth.
Ignoring him, Slim said suddenly:</p>

<p>"When you all going to Effin'ham?"</p>

<p>"Next week."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I'll get to go with you or not.
Mrs. King thinks I'd better stay here this summer.
What do you think about it?"</p>

<p>"I agree with her."</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Lautier came in, and, greeting Coleman
very cordially, Wyeth left them and went out on business.</p>

<p>He happened to have a delivery on Fourteenth street,
and when he had filled it, he stood talking with the girl
a moment. "Are you acquainted with Mr. V.R. Coleman?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Sure. He is a "<i>sort</i>" of agent for this book," Sidney
replied.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said she; "and I was wondering what
kind of an agent he must make, when he spends so much
time in this neighborhood. He goes with a certain party
next door, and he was there all last week. I think he
scarcely went outside."</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Sidney.</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said she. "I hope I'll enjoy the book."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The week arrived in which Wyeth was to depart, and
preparations were made to that end. He decided to
leave the office in charge of Mrs. Lautier. Slim came in
the day before he was to leave, looking frightened and
terribly upset. Always given to joking with him, Wyeth
hardly knew how to accept him, as he apparently was
that day. He was trembling in every limb as he cried:</p>

<p>"That woman! She's after me! Great God! I wish
she would leave me alone, I wish she would leave me
alone! She's followed me all over the country. She's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
like a ghost on my trail! And now she is at this moment
down in the street looking for me again!" Wyeth's
sympathy went out to him, and he cried:</p>

<p>"Quiet yourself! You'll surely go to pieces trembling
like that. After all, why should you become so excited?
You say you have advised her that you are not going
to live with her again."</p>

<p>"Aw, but you don't know; you don't understand.
She's got it on me, on me so strong until I dasn't make a
crooked move, or resort to the law. The only chance I
have is to keep out of her sight." He paused a spell
now, and his appearance was that of a man under sentence
of death. Then he said: "She has vowed to kill me, and
I know if she gets a chance she will!"</p>

<p>"I will go with you fellows to Effin'ham," he said more
calmly. "I've got to get away from where she can see
me, if I hope to live. Every moment I stay where I know
her to be near, will be moments of fear. I don't want to
kill her, even in self-defense. God, no! I don't want
murder on my hands!" He paced the floor at some
length, pausing at intervals to peep into the street, in
evident fright.</p>

<p>"She was out to Mrs. King's, night before last. Mrs.
King was not in, so she walked up to the front door of
the white people, and rang the bell. When the door was
opened by the man of the house, the expression he wore
got her goat. She made some excuse to the effect that it
was the wrong house, and went her way. Then, yesterday,
or last night rather, she came back. We were eating
supper, and it happened that my seat was so I could look
out the window, and up the alley. I saw her slipping up
this alley, near the side of the board fence, with a big
gun and it cocked. I rushed out the front way and
avoided her; but she is bent upon forcing me either to
live with her and submit to her tyranny, or she'll kill
me, and prevent me from living or being friendly with
any other."</p>

<p>"You seem certainly up against a bad proposition,
V.R.," said Wyeth, helplessly.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for a certain little deal back in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Carolina, I wouldn't be so afraid; but, owing to that,
I dare not do anything but keep out of her way," he
trembled on, woefully. "I'm going to try and slip out
of town unbeknown to her, and go along with you fellows
to Effin'ham. I'll be safe there for a while; but as soon
as she learns I am there, she'll take up the trail and I'll
have to 'beat' it elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Gee! It must be dreadful to live in the fear that
somebody is thirsting for your blood," said Wyeth, shuddering.</p>

<p>"I'll never be anything but a vagabond; a rover,
drifting over the face of the earth until death comes," he
cried despairingly.</p>

<p>He was calmed presently, with the prospect of going
to Effingham. Wyeth went uptown, attending to considerable
business in connection with the office, preparatory
to leaving. When this was completed, he went to a
movie, and returned to the office about six o'clock. He
went to another show that evening, and after that had
closed, strolled about the town until ten-thirty. There
appeared to be a gathering of women for some occasion
at the auditorium, which was breaking up when he
returned. Mrs. King and Coleman were leaving the
building when Wyeth came up. They started up the
street with the crowd. As they reached the corner, there
was a sudden commotion. Wyeth ran up, and was just
in time to see a woman dash after Coleman from around
the corner. He saw her before she got near him, and,
jerking free of his escort, he tore into the street. She
was a dark woman with coarse black hair, and of an
Indian appearance. With a cry she flew after him, as
she cried in a diabolical voice:</p>

<p>"At last, Vance Coleman, I have found you, and in
another's company. I am forced to stand aside, although
your wife!" Down the street his steps could be heard,
as he tore along in mad haste. She stopped when she
saw that she could not catch him, and, drawing from
some invisible direction, a gun, she levelled it, with
deliberate aim, at the flying figure. The crowd stood
frozen creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>And then suddenly, a terrible cry rent the still night
air, just as the gun went off; but the cry had disconcerted
her aim, and, with a cry she turned toward the
crowd, but Wyeth had the arm of the hand that held
the revolver, which he twisted and made the weapon fall
to the ground. She was led away presently by an officer,
while still, far down a street, the sound of hurriedly
retreating footsteps came to Wyeth's ears. He listened
until they died away in the night. Wyeth turned, and
disappeared in the direction of his room.</p>

<p>He never saw Slim again.</p>

<p class="center small">END OF BOOK ONE</p>

<p class="center"><i>Effingham</i></p>


<p>"I'll take that change now," whispered the porter,
nudging Wyeth, as he lay trying to sleep, as the train
roared westward toward Effingham, the iron city, and
greatest industrial southern center.</p>

<p>Raising up, he reached in his pocket while yet half
asleep, and handed the porter two dollars. "I paid fifty
cents for the ticket to Spruceville, as you know, and the
charge was to be two fifty?" The other nodded, and
pocketing the money, he melted away noiselessly.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Wyeth raised the shade and peered
out. The train was flying through a valley, that spread
away from either side of the single track, smooth and
unobstructed, except for comfortable farm homes, set
back from the roads. He looked back in the seat behind
him, observed young Hatfield, whom he was bringing
with him, dozing peacefully. Then he looked toward the
front of the car for the first time, and observed another
with whom he had become acquainted in Attalia. He
had never learned his name, in fact, he had never inquired
it; but, since the other possessed such long legs, and was
tall and good-natured into the bargain, he had called him
Legs, which had brought no objection on the part of the
other. And it is by that name we shall follow him in
this story.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" he greeted cordially, when their eyes
met. "And where did you get on and call yourself
going?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Books!" the other returned, as cordially.
He rose from his seat, shook himself as if to start the
blood, jumped about for a moment, rubbed his face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
then came back to where Wyeth was and sat down.
"Say," he cried, "a little liquah'd go good right now,
wouldn't it? I had some, but like a pig I emptied the
bottle last night. Oh, yes," he cried suddenly, "I'm
going to Chicago. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Effingham; but I wish I were on the way for old
Chi' along with you," said Wyeth. The other smiled
blandly, stretched his long legs in the isle, then got up,
went to the end of the car and looked around for a cup
out of which to drink; and, of course, not finding any,
he lifted the lid of the cooler, turned it over, and finding
it had a disk, drew it full and drank from it. Replacing
it, he came back and reseated himself. Since we shall
become quite familiar with him, and very shortly, a
description is quite necessary.</p>

<p>He was tall, over six feet, and a mulatto. His shoulders
were broad, while his chest was thin and flat. His head
was small, and straight up from his back, while he possessed
a pair of small ears that fitted closely and oddly
against his head&mdash;so oddly that, when one observed him
at a glance, he reminded one of an elf. He appeared to
be smiling always, although there was no great depth in
the same. His eyes were small, and danced about playfully
in his head, while his hips were arched and broad,
between which was a full stomach which made him
resemble a pickaninny.</p>

<p>"You see, it's like this," he began confidentially. He
lowered his voice almost to a whisper, and held his mouth
close to Wyeth's ear. "The reason you did not see me
when we left Attalia last night, was because I had the
porter lock me in the lavatory. I didn't come through
the gate at the station, but went out to the yards where
he concealed me. When the train was out of the town,
I came out; but you were reading and didn't look up,
when I came out and took that seat."</p>

<p>Wyeth observed him now wonderingly. He could not
understand this unconventional manner of boarding a
passenger train. He was not, however, left long in doubt.
In fact, before he could give words to the question his
eyes asked, the other enlightened him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"I's havin' a little game Sunday night, and the bulls
run in on me." It was now all clear to Wyeth. He
recalled the other's occupation. He had become acquainted
with him through "Spoon," and recalled that
he kept a rooming house for questionable purposes. In
addition to this, he sold liquor, and ran a game on Saturday
nights and Sundays&mdash;or any time a crowd gathered
with enough money to start.</p>

<p>"M-m. Did they arrest you?"</p>

<p>"No; that is what I's goin' t' tell. I got away; but
they got the rest of the bunch, every damn last one of
them, the fools! You see," he explained, warming to
the narrative, "it was not altogether my fault. It was
like this: I had a nigga watching, that is, I had him
hired to watch, but the d&mdash;&mdash;n fool was a whiskey head,
and had t' have a drink eve' ten minutes, claiming, of
course, that it was necessary that he have plenty of
booze t' keep himself awake."</p>

<p>Wyeth laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, I was 'head a the game and winning right
along, and didn't give a damn; so I fed him all he could
pour down. The result of this was that he got good and
full by and by, went off t' sleep, and the bulls walked
right in on us without a word of warning.</p>

<p>"We were shooting craps on the bed, and the game was
going along nicely. I was sitting at the head holding the
lamp, and getting the cuts. At least fifteen dollars was
in the betting, when, on hearing a slight noise to my back
like some one creeping, I looked around&mdash;and, man! The
room was full of bulls with dark lanterns, which they at
that moment flashed upon us!</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to do for a moment. 'Up with
yu' hands, niggers!' they cried. All the shines looked
then into the barrels of a bunch a-guns. 'Don't try no
monkey business there, you big nigger,' the sargent cried,
as he observed me shifting about. All the time, though,
I was edging toward a place I knew none ov'm didn't see.
Suddenly, I drops the lamp, and there is some tall cussin'.
A little pup&mdash;I think he was a sup'&mdash;put a star on the
back of my head"&mdash;he turned and Wyeth saw it. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
staggered about now like I was knocked out. They were
all over us now, a-hand cuffin' the nigga's like a lot of
cattle with halters. By this time I see's my way clear t'
make this break. One sucker spots me and cries: 'Look
out! That big nigga!' But they were too late. I had
my hand on the knob of a door that none ov'm have
seen; and, swinging it open quickly, I ducked out. As I
did so, one of the bulls takes a shot at me, but missed.
He was determined to have me, though, if possible, so
he comes after me in a hurry. That's where I am wise
and he wasn't. There is a fence a few feet from the
door, that he didn't see. Out he came after me in a
blind fury, and, 'bing!' He ran full into the fence, and
knocked the wind out of himself. I saw my chance.
I was mad and scared now, too; so I rushed upon him
while he was staggering about and 'bingo!' I landed on
him, and knocked him cold. Then I 'beat' it. I had his
gun and club and 'peeper,' and I flew. Out the back
way I went like a race horse. In the rear, two or three
bulls were a-workin' over this bull that I done knocked
stiff. I entered the alley, and ran until I reached Bell
street. An onry bunch of dogs kept barking away at me
as I hurried along, and kept me scared, because I's
afraid I'd be located by other bulls. I ran down one, a
little pug-nosed bull. He was game and tried to bite.
I reached down and got'm by the head, whirled him over
my shoulder three or four times, and when I turned him
loose, he landed beside a second story window, and fell
to the ground a dead dog, I didn't try to see. I then
began to jump fences. I bet I jumped a dozen fences,
and then got hung on the last one, which held my shirt.
I fell off at last, and liked to have bust open. My face
was bleeding, and my head, while my shirt was soaked.
I looked like the devil. I at last tore off the shirt, and
tried to tie up my head, then went to my brother-in-law's."</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed Sidney, "but you certainly had
some experience!"</p>

<p>"Aw, man, I done some runnin', believe me!" he
declared, and looked grim.</p>

<p>"They had plenty a-liquah&mdash;the bootlegs, too&mdash;, so's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
soon's I's cleaned up with my head bathed and a clean
shirt, I took a few drinks, and went to bed, feeling all
right.</p>

<p>"I laid around town hid away, until he could slip me
my clothes and a few dollars. So I happened to know
this porter, and arranged to come over tonight, and here
I am," and he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"How did those they arrested come out, and how come
the cops to be next to your little game?" Wyeth inquired,
casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," cried Legs. "I forget to tell you that part
of it. You see, there was a guy in the crowd&mdash;or had
been, rather, whose wife didn't want him to gamble.
Now he came down there and lost what little he had, and
went home drunk. His wife, of course, learned that he
had lost his money, and got sore. He was a damned
tramp, and told her the whole story, with tears, perhaps,
and you know a nigga with tears, so she went and put
the cops next.</p>

<p>"Now 'bout them other shines&mdash;the ones who got
arrested&mdash;they came before Judge Loyal's the next
morning, and got ten seventy-five each."</p>

<p>"I thought it was fifteen seventy-five for gaming."</p>

<p>"They were let off lighter, owing to the fact that I was
not brought. If they'd a caught me, it would have been
fifteen seventy-five for them, and about a hundred for me."</p>

<p>Wyeth laughed amusedly.</p>

<p>"You don't gamble or drink liquah, either, do you?"
he asked, and then answered his own question. "No, I
know you don't. You're lucky for using such common
sense. It doesn't pay, even if four nigga's out-a five do.
Yeh," he went on wearily, "only the straight and narrow
path leads to happiness in the long run," and with that
he turned on his side, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Say," he cried suddenly, raising up, "what did you
pay?" Then looked around quickly to see if he had been
overheard.</p>

<p>"Two and a half," the other replied. "How much
did you?"</p>

<p>Legs held up two fingers. "I told'm 't'was all I had,
and I didn't have but a precious little more."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with any one in Chicago?"
Wyeth inquired.</p>

<p>"Aw, yeh, a plenty; but I am not going on through
now. I'm going to stop in Effingham for a while, it
depends."</p>

<p>"Hello, Red," cried young Hatfield, coming up now,
rubbing his half closed eyes. "I see you got out all
right."</p>

<p>"Say, man!" cried Legs. "Didn't I get out of that
thing in luck?"</p>

<p>"Bet your life on that you did," commented Hatfield.
"If they'd have gotten you, the devil would have been
to pay." He laughed a low, hard laugh, and then added:
"Those church people have had their eyes on your
place for some time, and the chances are if you had
been caught, they'd have appeared against you."</p>

<p>"They certainly put old Jack Bell out of business
proper," Legs commented, thoughtfully. "That old
nigga conducted such a rotten dump and tiger, though;
and all those dirty little girls around on top of it, I don't
wonder."</p>

<p>"Wonder whether he had any money left when they
got through with him?" Hatfield inquired.</p>

<p>"Hard to tell," said Legs. "They fined him out of
hundreds, that I <i>do</i> know."</p>

<p>By this time, the train was entering the city. From
the car could be seen an incomplete mass of varied buildings,
little shacks that faced alleys, and at the front of
which played dozens of little unbleached pickaninnies.
Wyeth viewed the city as the train crept slowly along,
and his impression did not agree with what he had
gathered from reading of it. It was not, he felt positive,
the city Attalia was, although claiming almost an equal
number of people.</p>

<p>"You see those two brick cupola's extending into the
air?" he heard Hatfield saying. "That's a Negro Baptist
church." He was mistaken, however, for the same
proved to be the large, new station, the pride of the city.</p>

<p>Soon the train rolled into this, and a few minutes
later, they stood in the waiting room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's going to cost like the dickens to get all these
grips of your hauled," said Hatfield, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Only had to pay thirty-five cents to get them to the
depot in Attalia." He walked to the lower end of the
platform, and began a series of inquiries relative to the
hauling of the same. He soon came upon an express
man, who agreed to unload them for fifty cents, at where-ever
they found a room.</p>

<p>The three walked down a level street, paved with
brick. On either side a lot of houses appeared behind a
row of trees, dense with foliage. It was a calm, soft
morning, and the sun, red and glorious, was just peeping
out of the east. The street they followed led from the
depot into the business section. Perhaps eight blocks
ahead of them, several buildings of extraordinary height,
stood outlined far above those about them. Wyeth
counted the windows of two, and found them to total
sixteen.</p>

<p>"There are two or three buildings here higher than
any in Attalia," said Hatfield, following his gaze. "I
think the ones you have been noticing, are twenty-five
stories high."</p>

<p>The other whistled. "That's going some!"</p>

<p>Soon they were well into the business section. "Let's
go by and look at that hotel they have just completed
and opened," suggested Legs; for, just then, a little to
the right, the outline of that beautiful structure arose.
It was a grand affair, to say the least, and stood as a
monument to the enterprise of the populace. It was
claimed, by them, to be the swellest in the south.</p>

<p>"I think I can get on there after a bit," said Legs.
"I'm a head waiter by trade, but I haven't done any
hotel work for some little time now."</p>

<p>"I hear they brought all the waiters from the north,"
said Hatfield.</p>

<p>"Well," said Legs, "I'll <i>be</i> from the north when the
time comes, so I can make a fit if there is an opening."</p>

<p>"You'll pass, Red," laughed Hatfield, as they walked
onward now in a different direction.</p>

<p>As Wyeth saw Effingham, he observed that it lay very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
differently from Attalia. It had been built up recently,
so to speak, and had, therefore, broad, spacious streets,
unusually so, he thought, as he now found himself in the
heart of the business district. Perhaps they may have
seemed wider, because he had become accustomed to the
narrow highways of Attalia. In addition to the wide
streets, the sidewalks stretched back from the buildings
they fronted, from twelve to twenty feet, giving
pedestrians plenty of room to walk unconcernedly along.
As they continued on their way, he further observed that
the business section covered an unusually large area, and
it was hard to tell which might be called the main street.
As the street cars clanged by him, he noticed another
feature, also. The position occupied by the Negro passengers.
They entered and left the car from the front
instead of from the rear, as was the custom in Attalia.</p>

<p>"Negroes do lots of business in this town," said Hatfield,
as they came abreast of a large, new building, that
reached five stories into the air. "This, now," said he,
pausing and surveying the structure, "is the Dime
Savings Bank building." Wyeth, having read much
about the bank, observed the building carefully. To one
side, through the street door, there was no entry, or,
rather, the small entry was to one side of the building,
and not in the middle, and one elevator was in operation.
Straight back from where they stood, the open doors of
the bank (which the janitor was now sweeping) revealed
the inside of the institution.</p>

<p>A few hours later, their wanderings brought them
back again before the bank, which they entered. It
proved to be a busy place, and at that hour, was filled
with black people, depositing and withdrawing money,
and attending to other business in connection therewith.
He observed, in the first glance, that the furnishing was
elegant. Behind the first desk, enclosed by an oak office
fence, sat a black man, the cashier he thought, since the
insignia was plated conspicuously before him. And still
to the left of him, behind a grating with the insignia of
<i>Collections</i> before it, was another man, and he was blacker
still. And then, in the next cage, over which was labeled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
boldly, <i>Receiving Teller</i>, worked still another black man.
He was younger, and he worked rapidly, counting the
money that was continually being thrust to him. There
was another cage to the right of him, and this was marked
<i>Paying</i>. Behind this worked another black man, young
and intelligent, and seeming perfectly efficient, as had the
others. In the rear, working over books, he saw the first
mulatto. Another, brown-skinned this time, worked near
him, and these made up the active members of the bank.
No blue veins held sway here. It was truly a black
man's bank. It was, as he had long since learned, the
largest in the country conducted by black people, and
the footing exceeded a half million by almost a hundred
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Young Hatfield, who was a student in one of the
colleges of Attalia, had been to the city before, was well
acquainted, and pointed out the many places of interest,
and, in particular, those conducted by black people.</p>

<p>"The president of this bank, Dr. Jerauld," he explained,
"is in failing health, and is substituted by the
vice, Dr. Dearford."</p>

<p>"I see," acknowledged the other. "So the president,
then, is a physician."</p>

<p>"No," corrected the other, "a minister."</p>

<p>Wyeth recalled now, that "Reverend" or "Elder" was
almost a thing of the past among Negro preachers.
They were all called, and called themselves "doctors."
But he did not then realize to what extent this title was
usurped. Beyond the instant of medicine and dentistry,
he had noted that "doctor" was an honorary term, conferred
upon men who had done something notable in the
evolution of mankind; but he was soon to learn that the
title had become a fetish with his people, sought after
and preempted by any and everyone without even the
remotest right to claim it.</p>

<p>"Everything that has ever been started down south
has been done by the preachers. A Negro preacher down
here, in the past in particular, has headed everything.
Of course, that would be natural, granting that almost
every man with ambition to be before the public has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
been a preacher," Hatfield explained. "Now, for example,
the largest insurance company in Attalia&mdash;that is,
with offices there and conducted by our people&mdash;has for
its president, a preacher located in this town."</p>

<p>"I've heard of him. His name is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dr. Walden," he explained. "He's the pastor of a
big church on the other side of town. Dr. Jerauld,
before he retired, was pastor of the Sixth Avenue church."</p>

<p>"And what denomination do these preacher business
men represent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Baptist, of course. As I said, they are at the
head of everything, including," and he smiled humorously,
"a great many wives of other men." They both
laughed, and Legs, who was almost forgotten, joined in.</p>

<p>By this time, they were wandering aimlessly down
a street that finally came to an end, and ran abruptly
into a brick wall. Changing their course into another
street, they continued their indefinite pilgrimage. Presently,
they paused before one or two neat looking houses,
and inquired regarding rooms. Both were full. A convention
of preachers was still in session, which explained
the state of circumstances. So, on again they went,
until they paused at a corner. A middle-aged woman
sat on the front porch of a house that rose to two stories,
and was decorated with two vine-laden porches. The
house appeared to contain possibly seven or eight rooms.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mis'!" exclaimed Legs, in greeting so familiar
that Wyeth felt he surely must know her.</p>

<p>"How-do," she answered as familiarly and smiling.</p>

<p>"Three tramps we are from Attalia, and without a
place to roost. Do you happen to have a spare pole or
two?"</p>

<p>"Sho has. Come upon the po'ch and be seated," she
invited.</p>

<p>"A-hem. That's when you said something," smiled
Legs, "eh, Mis'?" She joined in the humor.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Legs, when they were comfortably
seated, "this looks good to me. Supposing we just
hang up here, and send for our stuff?"</p>

<p>It was agreeable to the other two, and they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
therefore, duly installed, three in a room. Legs, being
the longest, was given a bed to himself, while Hatfield
and Wyeth agreed to share another together. It was
fortunate for both that it was arranged thus, since Legs
proved to be a dreadful night man, and, from his apparently
restless way of tossing, required a halter.</p>

<p>"Any saloons around here, Mis'?" he inquired shortly,
when she reappeared on the porch a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"Sho is!" she exclaimed. "Yeh, most sho. Go right
down this street, turn the corner, and across the street
near the other corner, is what you want," she laughed,
taking them all for granted. Wyeth and Hatfield followed
Legs to the inevitable fountain he now sought
energetically.</p>

<p>"Got t' have a little liquah before I c'n feel like myself,"
he grinned, as they sauntered along.</p>

<p>"Hello!" called some one from the rear. Turning,
they observed a medium sized Negro walking rapidly in
their direction, and beckoning to them. They halted,
and presently he stood before them, introducing himself.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, gentlemen," he began very properly;
"but the Mis' back there," pointing in the direction of
the house they had just left, "was telling me that you
have just taken a room with her, and, since I am the
man of the house, I wish to offer my name and make
you welcome."</p>

<p>He was very cordial. His name was Moore, John
Moore, he said, and to describe him, our pen fails to a
degree. He had, however, an odd looking face. His
cheek bones were high, slightly Indian-like, while his
face was broad. His nose was not flat, nor was it high
or medium, it was&mdash;just a nose, that's all. He held his
head forward aggressively, his eyes were twinkling, and
possessed a cordiality that, to a careful observer, was
distrustful. And still, his appearance in general, was that
of a Negro who might be expected to bluff, but not to
fight; to steal when the opportunity was ripe, with enough
cunningness to keep from being caught. Otherwise, he
was apparently harmless.</p>

<p>They acknowledged his welcome, and, joining them,
they all went toward the place of happiness by proxy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm buyin' this," said Moore, as they lined the bar,
four abreast.</p>

<p>"Let me do the buying this time," insisted Legs, who
proved himself a sport, and a good mixer.</p>

<p>"I've paid him already," said Moore, as if in dismissal,
shoving at the same time, a half dollar across
the bar.</p>

<p>"Whiskey," nodded Legs familiarly, to the bartender.</p>

<p>"Little liquah, too," from Moore.</p>

<p>"Beer."</p>

<p>"Beer."</p>

<p>"Drink whiskey!" insisted Legs and Moore, of the
other two. "Something that has the kick."</p>

<p>"These are my sons," said Legs, teasingly.</p>

<p>"Hold on heh', George," argued Moore with the bartender,
"you know how I take mine. A half-a-pint 'n'
two glasses." The bartender obeyed.</p>

<p>Here Wyeth observed, was diplomacy, albeit economy.
Moore paid twenty-five cents for the half pint, wherein
he and Legs had six sociable drinks, three a-piece;
whereas, the same would have totalled sixty cents otherwise.</p>

<p>"How's this town for gettin' hold a-something?"
inquired Legs of Moore, when John Barleycorn was
doing his duty.</p>

<p>"Best town in the south to get it, if you're wise,"
Moore winked.</p>

<p>Legs responded with a big wink. "I'm the man that
put 'w' in whiskey," he smiled. "I'n get mine when
it's in the gettin'."</p>

<p>"What's your line?" from Moore, pouring more
whiskey.</p>

<p>"Anything from heavin' coal to sellin' liquah and
operatin' a crap game, and a little 'skin' when the
crowd's right."</p>

<p>"I see," said the other thoughtfully, then added:
"And your friends?"</p>

<p>"This lad here is going to school to learn how to get
'his without workin'; while the other boy," pointing to
Wyeth, "is already doin' it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, men," began Moore, as he opened a fresh half
pint that Legs paid for, "as I said, 'f you're <i>wise</i>, Effingham
is the best town in the country for pickin's. It is,
as you should know, the greatest industrial center in the
south."</p>

<p>"So I have understood," interposed Wyeth, waiving
the bartender's invitation aside; "I am anxious to learn
something, everything about the town, and the colored
people."</p>

<p>"Are they employed in considerable numbers at the
mines, steel mills and furnaces about here, of which the
city possesses so many?"</p>

<p>"Thousands upon thousands," he was informed.</p>

<p>"And how are they paid? From a personal standpoint,
I'd be glad to know?" went on Wyeth.</p>

<p>"All kinds of wages, and at various times. Some
receive as low as a dollar and a quarter, while others
make as high as seven and eight; but the average wage
runs from a dollar fifty, to three dollars."</p>

<p>"How's the crap games?" from Legs, with the usual
smile.</p>

<p>"Nigga's will shoot craps, yu' know," grinned Moore.
"I shoot a little myself when the moon's right," he
winked.</p>

<p>"I want t' find a good game as soon as possible, and
win about a hundred," said Legs, beginning to show the
effects of liquor. Hatfield and Wyeth left them to their
cheerful diversion, which was now, to all appearance,
warming to the superlative.</p>

<p>The former went toward town, looking for certain
friends. Wyeth went back to the place where he was
going to stay, and retired. They had called up for their
luggage before they went to the saloon. Wyeth was
sleeping peacefully, when he was aroused by an argument
on the porch. He tried to close his ears, but the same
was persistent. It was between the landlady and the
expressman, who had arrived with the stuff.</p>

<p>"That little trunk is as heavy as lead," he heard that
worthy saying.</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it," from the landlady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
"They left fifty cents here to pay for it, and you must
have agreed to that amount, or they would have left
more."</p>

<p>"Seventy-five cents, seventy-five cents. That little
trunk is like something filled with bricks."</p>

<p>"My trunk," mumbled Wyeth, coming to himself, and
listening to the argument. "And that sucker is trying to
work her. The dirty cur!" he now cried, angry for two
reasons. One for being disturbed when he was sleeping
so peacefully, and another for being worked, or trying
to be. With a bound he was on the floor, and in a jiffy
he was in his trousers and upon the porch.</p>

<p>"Well, 'f' y' ain' go'n pay it, I'll haf t' take th' stuff
back," the expressman said, as Wyeth came up. The
other did not see him until he mounted the porch. Then
he looked into his eyes which were fighting, and recoiled.</p>

<p>"What's this you are going to do!" he demanded,
filling the doorway, and bestowing upon the other, a look
that corresponded with his feelings.</p>

<p>"Well, stuff I brung down heah's mor'n I thought
't'was, so I'll haf t' have a quarter mo'!"</p>

<p>"What kind of a proposition did we make with you in
regard to hauling it at the depot awhile ago?"</p>

<p>"You said yu'd give me a haf a-dollah fo' haulin' it,
but I didn't say I'd do it fo' a haf," he sulked, evasively.</p>

<p>Wyeth glared at him, but the other refused to meet
his eye. "Then," he began, "when you took hold of it
and loaded it into your wagon, you subsequently agreed
to my offer, and now I want to see you get more."</p>

<p>"I'll haf t' take the stuff," argued the other, shifting
about, but keeping at a safe distance. Something in the
eye of the other did not offer welcome.</p>

<p>"Give him a quater more," called Legs, who had returned
in the meantime, and had been trying to catch a little
sleep.</p>

<p>"I don't intend to pay him one little dime more!"
exclaimed Wyeth stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Then I'll haf t' see 'n' officer," bluffed the other, and
turning, he started briskly down the street. Wyeth
learned later, he was sure he could not have found one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
He was not looking for any, but the landlady and Legs
made up the quarter, and calling him back, paid him.</p>

<p>"Books is stubborn when he thinks he's been worked.
M-m," said Legs, going back to bed. "Yeh, comes
down to a show, believe he'd fight."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>These Negroes in Effingham Are Nigga's Proper</i>"</p>


<p>The next day dawned calm and beautiful, and Sidney
made preparations to begin his canvassing. In one city
in Ohio, and which was also a great industrial center, he
had found much success in selling his book to the multitude
of workers employed there. Therefore, with what
Moore had already told him, he was anxious to get his
work under way.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary, of course, would be to secure
agents. School had closed recently, and he had intended
coming to the city, to enlist some of the teachers for
that work. Securing a number of names and addresses,
he began calling on them, but without any immediate
success. Late that afternoon, however, a teacher, a
settled woman, gave him the name and address of one
whom she felt, she assured him, would take up the work.
"At least," she said, "she always does something during
vacation. Her name is Miss Palmer," so thither he went.</p>

<p>She lived not far away, and near the center of a block
in a small two story house, rusty and somewhat ramshackle.
He mounted the steps, which were perhaps
a half dozen, and asked for her. She was out, they informed
him, but was expected to return shortly. Before
they were through telling him, she came. She was a
brown-skinned woman, although in the fading twilight,
she struck him as being a mulatto. Of medium height
and size, she gave a welcome that played about the
corners of her small mouth. Her chin was long and
tapered to a small point, which made her appearance
unusual; her eyes were small, very small, and playful.</p>

<p>They were very soon in conversation, and he was
pleased to learn, after he had talked with her a few
minutes, that she was a woman with the strength of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
convictions, although there was something about her he
did not, and was not likely, he felt, to understand for
some time to come, and he didn't.</p>

<p>Presently he stated the object of his visit, and suggested
that she take up the work during her vacation.
She shook her head dubiously, and said:</p>

<p>"I don't mind canvassing; but I don't want to sell
books."</p>

<p>"Why not books?" he inquired, in a tone of surprise,
and then added: "It would seem that, being a teacher,
selling a nice book would be preferable to something
else."</p>

<p>"Yes, that may be," said she, thoughtfully now,
"but nigga's here don't read. At least they won't buy
and pay for books. Sell them toilet articles or hair
goods, something to straighten their kinks or rub on their
faces, anything guaranteed to make their hair grow soft
and curly, or their black faces brighter."</p>

<p>He laughed long. She now observed him with something
akin to admiration. "Then the people of your
community&mdash;the black people&mdash;don't consider feeding
the mind an essential to moral welfare," he suggested
mirthfully.</p>

<p>"Naw, Lord," she replied flatly. "These Negroes in
Effingham are nigga's proper. They think nothing about
reading and trying to learn something, they only care for
dressing up and having a good time."</p>

<p>He was silent and resigned for a time. They now sat
together in a swing that hung suspended from the porch.
Directly, when he had said nothing for some time, she
looked again at him, and with something in her demeanor
that was anxious.</p>

<p>"What book is it?" she inquired.</p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>"That's a good title, and should take if anything will,"
she said, a little more serious now than before. She did
not impress Wyeth as being much of a literary person, as
he now observed her. For a moment, he felt the interest
wane, that he had experienced the moment she came up.
She was speaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sold books one summer, 'Up From Bondage,' by
the greatest Negro the race has ever known, and I had
a time! I never want such another experience! They
told me a thousand lies, and had me trotting after them
all summer," whereupon, she shrugged her shoulders disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I'm confident there are people, and
plenty, who <i>do</i> care to read, and will likewise buy when
the book is properly presented. So, of course, the duty
of a distributer, will be to find these people, and it is for
this purpose, I am here. I do not, of course, know what
kind of a black population you have; but it is reasonable
to suppose that, if I could and did, personally sell twelve
hundred copies in Attalia in a matter of five months,
I should be able to find a few readers here. Do you not
agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said she; "but you cannot as yet
appreciate the fact that Effingham has the orneriest
Negroes in the world. I am frank when I say that I do
not have any confidence in them, but wait," she admonished,
"you'll find out."</p>

<p>They sat together now, and conversed on topics otherwise
than books and literature, which he observed, could
be engaged in with more success. Moreover, as the
minutes wore on, he also came to see that Miss Palmer
was somewhat sentimental. She smiled freely, moved
close at times, and then away, artfully; saw him at
moments out of liquid eyes, and said her words with a
coquetishness that came by careful practice.</p>

<p>And so, Sidney Wyeth, a man free to practice the arts
of coquetry&mdash;if a man may do so&mdash;accepted Miss Palmer's
attention, and to that end he soon became a friend.</p>

<p>When he departed that evening, she had taken the
agency, and had agreed to go with him on the morrow.</p>

<p>That night it rained, a heavy rain, and when he went
forth the following morning, the streets were heavy with
mud wherever there was no paving&mdash;which was, in this
part of town, almost everywhere. Moreover, it showed
signs of raining more. It had been one of the dryest
springs the south had ever seen, and it was now probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
that the deficiency in rainfall would be eradicated by
an excess in moisture.</p>

<p>Wyeth, however, was impatient to begin as soon as
possible. He wished to ascertain to what extent intelligence
and regard for higher morals was prevalent in this
town.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer was not ready when he arrived, and it
was two hours before she was. "Thought since it rained,"
she explained, "that you would not, perhaps, go out
today."</p>

<p>"Won't know the difference this time next year," he
jested, with a cheerful smile, nevertheless, surveying the
threatening elements anxiously.</p>

<p>"If we go into the quarter districts," she advised, "we
will most likely get our feet wet&mdash;muddy."</p>

<p>"Are there no sidewalks out there?" he inquired.</p>

<p>They had decided, the evening before, at her suggestion,
to begin in one of the many little towns, inhabited
by Negroes employed in the mines, mills and
furnaces, that made Effingham what it was. These little
towns encircle the city proper, laying, many of them, at
a considerable distance, to be incorporated as part of the
city.</p>

<p>Some years before&mdash;between one census and the next&mdash;this
city is recorded to have trebled and over in population.
It had, but in doing so, it gathered all these little
burgs for miles around. Some of them were even beyond
the car lines, which were built to them after the city had
incorporated them, and counted the people as a part of
the population of Effingham. Wyeth perhaps, as well
as the world at large, had not known this. The population,
at this time, was estimated to be one hundred
sixty-six thousand. Of this amount, two-fifths were
Negroes. Only a portion had been born in Effingham;
the rest came in the last few years, in great, ignorant
hordes from the rural parts of the state, and from the
states adjoining. And as Wyeth soon came to know,
they included some of the most depraved and vicious
creatures humanity has known&mdash;but of this, our story
will reveal in due time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The most extraordinary part of Effingham, was its
staggering number of churches. That is, among the
Negroes. Notwithstanding the fact that the city was
the resort of every escaped convict, and the city where
every freed one headed for, which, of course, naturally
made it the scene of excessive depravity, there was, apparently,
a great amount of pious worship. Wyeth
recalled, as he became better acquainted with the city
and the people, that a year before, in a northern city,
he had one day, gone to the library, where he found the
directories of all cities of any significance. He was
preparing a circular campaign, and, in going through
the various directories, chanced to look through the part
of those of the southern cities that had recorded the
churches. Effingham had, according to an old one,
almost a hundred Negro churches.</p>

<p>But, having digressed at some length, we will return
now to Miss Palmer and Sidney Wyeth, preparing to
spread intelligence among a people who greatly needed it.</p>

<p>"Sidewalks!" Miss Palmer exclaimed, in derision,
"Lordy, they hardly have streets in some places!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later, they were sailing through the
country&mdash;although it was counted as part of the city&mdash;to
a town, a suburb, nine miles distant, a suburb of mills.
"I used to sell toilet articles out there, on and right after
pay days, and did quite well," said she, as the heavy car
thundered along at a great rate of speed, for an inter-urban.
"I am skeptical in regard to books, though,
because these are 'bad' nigga's, with the exception of a
precious few good ones."</p>

<p>They were just then passing through a district that was
well kept, and apparently quiet. "We are now in a part
of the town, where a large number of the better class of
our people reside," she said, "and I am going to point
out the homes of some of them."</p>

<p>"There is where Mr. Judson, paying teller at the Dime
Savings Bank, lives." She pointed to a handsome
bungalow, setting well back from the street, and surrounded
by many young trees, with a well kept lawn
upon three sides. "Now over there is where Paul Widner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
contractor and builder, has his home." Following the
direction of her finger, he was moved by the sumptuous
and imposing structure that met his gaze. "That is the
finest residence owned and occupied by one of our kind
in the city," she said, with evident pride. "Still, though,
here is Dr. Jackson's, which is almost as fine," and she
pointed to another that was a credit. "He is the financial
secretary of one of the church denominations of the south.</p>

<p>"See that long house over there?" she pointed to
another. "That is Dr. Wayland's. He runs the drugstore."</p>

<p>"A preacher?"</p>

<p>"No; a pharmacist."</p>

<p>They were now in the wood, a deep forest with great
trees all about, that darkened the inside of the car. The
picked over and slim pines, mingled with large water
oaks, rose gloomily against the heavy clouds that now
rumbled ominously overhead. Before long, large drops
of water began an intermittent patter on the car roof,
while the windows were spat upon occasionally. And
then, of a sudden, the very heavens seem to open, and
the rain fell in torrents. Through it the heavy car
pushed resolutely forward. The line was one recently
completed, and facilitated travel between the city and
the suburb wonderfully. Built of steel, the cars were
long and heavy, with doors that opened near the center,
allowing the colored passengers to enter on one side of
the conductor, who operated the doors, from a convenient
position near the furtherest side of the opening.</p>

<p>"We will surely get soaked today," grumbled Miss
Palmer, but not lightly, for she trembled on observing
the terrific downpour.</p>

<p>"How much further is it to this place we are going?"
he inquired. To him, it seemed they had been riding an
hour. "You do not mean to tell me, that all that stretch
of forest and open country before we got to the forest,
is a part of Effingham?"</p>

<p>"We will soon be there now," she evaded, and then
added: "Effingham includes everything that electric cars
operating in and out of the city reaches," and laughed.
He believed her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, the big car came to a stop. They alighted in
the downpour, and rushed to shelter beneath the porch
of a small grocery store, conducted by a kind-faced little
colored woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, how-do, Mrs. Brown," cried Miss Palmer, when
the latter, upon seeing them, opened the door and bade
them enter. "I'm certainly glad to see you," whereupon
they kissed, and Miss Palmer cheered the dark atmosphere
with many cute words.</p>

<p>"Permit me, Mrs. Brown, to introduce Mr.&mdash;&mdash;I
forget your name?" "You see, Mr. Wyeth," said Miss
Palmer, with a delightful smile, "I taught out here these
past three years, and Mrs. Brown is one of my many
friends. Yonder is the school," she pointed to an old
frame building, that could barely be outlined through the
storm. "They have transferred me back to the city
again," she turned to Mrs. Brown. "So I regret to say
that I shall not be with you next year."</p>

<p>Miss Palmer had a way of finishing her sentences with
a show of her fine little teeth; and her chin, at such a
time, reached to a fine point, which at first amused
Sidney. She would bestow upon him a coquettish smile,
when she found his eyes searching her mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wyeth," said she, with her arm linked now within
Mrs. Brown's, "is general agent for a new book by a
Negro author, <i>The Tempest</i>, and for which I have accepted
the local agency&mdash;why not," she broke off suddenly,
"show Mrs. Brown the book?"</p>

<p>"She is clever and suggestive at the same time,"
thought Sidney, almost aloud; but he forthwith obeyed
the suggestion with much pleasure, and took Mrs. Brown's
order amid the rainfall, collecting twenty-five cents as a
guarantee of good faith, in addition.</p>

<p>It had ceased raining as suddenly as it had commenced.
They turned to leave the store, and, as he
was passing Miss Palmer, he bumped against her roughly.
She was looking at his picture on the frontispiece now,
with apparent suspicion. He pretended not to see her or
her suspicion, that had now grown to excitement. She
was yet apparently in some doubt, as she tried to make
connections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here! Look here!" she exclaimed at last, in
subdued excitement. "This picture! This picture! It is
you! You!" She held the book open, and looked at him
in amazement. He waved her aside depreciatively, and
passed outside, while she continued gazing at the picture
in a state of excitement. She followed him, and they
were alone.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me this?" she cried, unable to
stem her tide of excitement. She had lost interest, for
the present, in all else, and pursued: "You, the author
of this book!" She now saw him as another person
entirely. Feeling much put out, he felt something should
be resorted to, to dissipate the spell.</p>

<p>"I'm not the author," he said, with straight face.
"Where shall we go now?" his demeanor was calm and
imperious.</p>

<p>"Stop next door&mdash;no, that's Mrs. Brown's house," she
said, as she followed him in a meditative mood. "The
next house," he heard her say, as if speaking from far
away. Miss Palmer was now serious, and very thoughtful.</p>

<p>Disturbed by her discovery, and, in a measure, disconcerted,
Wyeth concentrated himself upon the demonstration
of the book to a creditable degree that morning;
and, one by one, with his voice and look charged with
dynamite, he secured those black people's orders, and the
deposit wherever they had the amount available. Miss
Palmer merely followed him, insisting upon the point of
authorship, until, with a touch of impatience, he admonished
her that their purpose, on that occasion, was to
sell the book, the author, therefore, insofar as they were
concerned, was a matter of secondary consideration.</p>

<p>"Going to be angry with me so soon?" she pined,
looking into his eyes with a feigned appeal. In spite of
himself, he smiled back disconcertedly.</p>

<p>"You are the author, though, aren't you?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>He ignored the question.</p>

<p>"We have eleven orders, and have collected a dollar
and seventy-five cents, in exactly an hour and a half,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
she informed him, at the end of that time. "Whether
you <i>did</i> or did <i>not</i> write this book&mdash;say what you will,
I'm convinced you did&mdash;you <i>do</i> know how to sell it. I
never heard a man talk so fast and so effectively in my
life!"</p>

<p>"I must leave you now," he said. "I have agreed to
be back in town for the afternoon, and help start my
young friend."</p>

<p>"Please don't leave me," she whispered artfully, and
smiled in her winning way, then suddenly hurried into
the next house.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Thought you had quit me for good, Books," complained
young Hatfield, when he saw Wyeth, on his
return to the city. "When we goin' out?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I have fed my face, and the car will take
us to&mdash;where, or what is that place you spoke of? Where
the girls work in service?"</p>

<p>"South Highlands," he replied.</p>

<p>They followed the street until they came to the main
street, or rather, to one of the main streets, and caught
a car from the front end, that took them to the North
Highlands, and not to the South, as they were accustomed
to go.</p>

<p>"You'll have to pay carfare back, Books," said Hatfield.
"I have only fifteen cents left."</p>

<p>"Go right over to where you see that girl, that little
colored girl standing on the steps that lead to the rear,
and tell her the tale of <i>The Tempest</i>, and get her order,"
said Wyeth, when at last they had come to the right place.</p>

<p>"I thought I would go along with you this afternoon,"
he said with a frown, but obeyed the command, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Sidney found him where they had
left each other. "What have you done?" he asked
holding back a frown, because he felt the student had
succumbed to a lack of confidence; but he was cheered
in a degree, when the other replied:</p>

<p>"I got four, how many did you get?"</p>

<p>"Eight," and they went on their way rejoicing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_THREE_2" id="CHAPTER_THREE_2"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>"I Have BEEN Married," Said She</i></p>


<p>Thirty-five years ago, Effingham was an unsuspected
factor. That was before somebody had demonstrated
that the chain of red hills encircling the then small town,
contained immense deposits of iron ore and coal, and
other mineral matter, that could be converted into
practical purposes.</p>

<p>Effingham lay, at that time, in the valley, where, as
yet, most of it is found; then, it was regarded as only
an ordinary town, without any expectation of future
greatness. It had, to be exact, thirty-eight thousand,
fourteen years ago, fifteen thousand Negroes, and the
remainder white population, including a few Chinese.
Today, the city boasts of approximately one hundred
seventy thousand.</p>

<p>Thus the city had developed, regardless of circumstances,
which our story will unfold.</p>

<p>But Sidney Wyeth, our erstwhile observer and literary
contemporary, had not been long in Effingham, before
he had come to learn that it was not the city Attalia was,
in spite of its great industries, and its million dollar payroll,
which was employed in advertising the iron city.</p>

<p>To begin with, capital&mdash;hard cash&mdash;was a very expensive
thing to use toward the development of its
extension. When the city incorporated the many little
towns that make up a large part of its present population,
it began to run in debt; a great deficit was customary
at the end of each year, and now, at the time of our
story, it was still energetically engaged in the same
task&mdash;piling up a deficit. The many little towns that
are a part of the city, and where most of the great industrial
concerns are located, are practically controlled
by the interests. But when the Tennessee Coal and Iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Company became a vested interest, it took over all these
various concerns, and merged them into a trust, which
is a problem to every congress. And now as Sidney
Wyeth saw it, the company owned everything. It almost
owned the Negroes, and thousands of foreigners who
were employed by the company.</p>

<p>But there was one thing the T.C.I. company did not
own, and that was train loads of liquor consumed by
its black help, and, of course, the whites also, to a degree,
but not in such proportion. Drink was very popular in
Effingham, exceedingly popular. It operated to an
alarming degree everywhere, and about pay days, held
sway in certain portions of the town, and made everything
run riot. And yet there were not nearly so many
saloons in Effingham as there might have been. It cost
too much for the privilege. At three thousand dollars a
year, only about one hundred fifty saloons were in
operation. But some years before, while the state was
under prohibition, "tigers" became the order. And now
many of them still operated. Especially on Sunday and
after closing hours, they were busy. They dealt in a
liquor known, in general, as "busthead;" and to say that
it deserved such a title, is saying little enough.</p>

<p>It was Miss Palmer, who became at once a personal
friend of Wyeth's, and who first told him of these conditions.
From her, before he had time to observe of his
own initiative, he also learned a great deal in regard to
the black people.</p>

<p>He was waiting on the porch for her when she returned
late that afternoon, in fact, it was night when she arrived.
She was tired, but cheerful and greatly encouraged. She
had secured eleven orders for his book, and collected
considerable more deposits in connection therewith.</p>

<p>"I certainly did some talking to those Negroes this
afternoon," she exclaimed, drawing herself upon the
porch when she arrived. "I talked a blue streak; and
believe me, one after another succumbed," she boasted.</p>

<p>"You work too late," he said, with a note of kindness
and admiration in his voice. "I do not usually work to
exceed six hours a day, and quit by six at the latest,"
he added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the trouble with Annie," said her cousin, and
a teacher also. "She has so much ambition when she
sees herself succeeding, that she invariably wears herself
out."</p>

<p>"Have you met my roomers?" Miss Palmer inquired.
He shook his head and waited, while she, with much
ostentation, introduced them one by one.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Jones, who carries mail upon a rural
route; Mr. Farrell is a student at Tuskegee. He is
spending his vacation in our city. And you have been
talking with my cousin, Miss Black."</p>

<p>Mr. Farrell was a small creature, so black in the darkness
of the night, that only a gloomy outline of his features
was discernable, while his white eyes reminded Sidney
as he winked them, of a pair of lightning bugs on a warm
June night. This was augmented by the occasional flash
of his white teeth. He was studying architectural drawing.
There was another student from the same school,
a West Indian Negro, and who, like his kind, was always
apparently desirous of learning, and asked Sidney many
questions. Mr. Jones, who happened to be another
cousin of Miss Palmer, and the aforementioned mail
carrier, was a suave creature who read books, and discoursed
with much practical intelligence.</p>

<p>The following morning, Miss Palmer and Sidney were
starting toward the car, on their way to canvass, when
they stepped in a small drugstore conducted by a tall,
slender man, of about thirty-five. Wyeth had been in
the store two evenings before, or the day he arrived,
and overheard a big argument. He had now come to
know, that this was a place for warm debate, with the
druggist ever conspicuous as one of the debaters.</p>

<p>He had not displayed his book there, or suggested a
sale to the druggist. There were certain classes of his
race to whom he never made a practice of showing the
book for several reasons. The first and most significant
of these reasons was, that he almost always found the
Negroes who were engaged professionally, including
teachers, not very appreciative of the work of their race,
although any of them would have been insulted if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
were told them. He had also made observation from
other sources, concerning the possible sale of his book.
His decision to dispense henceforth with showing the
book to certain classes, had resulted, because of a little
incident the year before in Cincinnati. He had observed
the same in other cities before he reached Cincinnati.
In Dayton, Indianapolis, and elsewhere; but in Cincinnati,
it was so evident, that he was, in a way, ashamed
to tell it afterwards. This is what occurred:</p>

<p>The colored people were making great efforts to secure
a Y.M.C.A., and were, when he left the city, within
fifteen thousand dollars of the amount they were required
to raise. The white people had given sixty thousand.
He became well acquainted with the secretary, and it
was from him that he learned, without inquiring, that,
of twenty-nine colored teachers who were receiving a
minimum of sixty dollars a month, twenty-one had not
subscribed one dollar toward this small amount the
colored people were strenuously trying to raise. And of
the eight who had subscribed, five had grudgingly given
one dollar each. The secretary, himself a former teacher,
admitted this with great humiliation.</p>

<p>Wyeth had always found the teachers profuse with
excuses, when it came to buying the book. And he had
found the doctors little better; but, to avoid what he
had grown to expect, and which he invariably met, he
had decided to ignore this class of his race. He did not
offer criticism upon the whole teaching staff, because, of
the three teachers out of twenty-nine in Cincinnati, who
had actually contributed toward the colored Y.M.C.A.,
the professor had shown his sincerity and race appreciation,
by subscribing one hundred dollars, and had paid it.</p>

<p>So Sidney Wyeth would never have shown the book to
the druggist, with a view of sale, but Miss Palmer did.
In her insistent manner, she urged him to buy. Now
Wyeth, as was his custom, always went to the leading
book store in each town, and had never failed to sell
them a few books. The leading store in Effingham had
purchased ten copies, and had placed an advertisement
of ten inch space in the colored paper, that ran for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
month, and which the druggist had seen. So, when Miss
Palmer approached him insistently, he declared that he
had seen the book advertised at that store, and, as was
their custom, sometime during the year they offered all
books at forty-nine cents, he would, if he wanted the
book, purchase it then. Of course, he didn't want it,
and Wyeth was provoked that Miss Palmer had even
shown it to him; but Miss Palmer had, and, upon being
told of these conditions, she at once ceased her efforts.</p>

<p>Of course, the druggist was wrong, and Wyeth knew it;
but the druggist didn't. He wanted to bet&mdash;any amount,
that he was right&mdash;that one of the biggest booksellers in
the southland, offered all books, regardless of "best
sellers," sometime during the year at forty-nine cents a
copy. It cost the druggist two dollars to learn that he
could be wrong, or mistaken at least, even if he had
<i>been to school and graduated from college</i>, which, in the
minds of his august contemporaries, meant that he <i>knew</i>
everything.</p>

<p>It was Miss Palmer who advised Sidney that Dr.
Randall, for druggists were called doctors also, among these
people, had <i>been to school and graduated from college</i>....
And Miss Palmer was much chagrined that Wyeth had
acted so hastily.... For times were hard and two dollars
was <i>something</i>.... If he had caught her eye when she
tried so hard to get his, she would have gotten him outside
for a minute, one little minute, and then she would
have told him who the other was.... She was almost in
tears as she remonstrated with him for his hasty act....
Miss Palmer was sincere and meant it, because, for some
reason, she was unable as yet to account; she really
liked Mr. Wyeth. "He has such eyes," she told her
cousin when she returned, while the bet was being settled.</p>

<p>"Well, we have lost two hours, so we will have to get
a move on us now, to make up for lost time. Of course,"
he said cheerfully, "I've made two dollars, which is as
much, maybe more, than we would have made in the
meantime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did what!" Miss Palmer was amazed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>It was some time before she could be brought to
believe it.</p>

<p>"We will go to a different part of the quarter today,"
she said after a time. Wyeth looked at her. Miss Palmer
was very kind. And Sidney Wyeth longed for kindness.
When he saw Miss Palmer as she was that day, he felt
something amiss in his heart. She had said nothing
today; whereas, yesterday she had acted, he thought,
boldly.</p>

<p>The car now seemed to be flying through space. It
roared like a mad thing, and filled him with a peculiar
feeling; exhilaration overwhelmed him. For one moment
he forgot everything, and he felt a burning desire to
touch the woman. At his side sat Miss Palmer. She
had been kind to him, even though he had known her
almost no time. And then suddenly his hand found hers,
and, closing over it one moment, he crushed it. A
moment later the impulse had passed.</p>

<p>The powerful car thundered on its way.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer worked hard that day. All the hours
through, she talked and talked. She simply <i>made</i> those
black people buy. "The story of a young man, a young
man of our race, who had the strength and courage of a
pioneer, went alone into the wilds of the great northwest,
and there made conquest. Think of that as an example,
and incentive to effort for your children!" They nodded
and joined her in seriousness, though they knew not what
it all meant; but they did feel the strength of her eyes,
and the insistence held them.</p>

<p>Wyeth suggested the route.</p>

<p>She offered no objection. Whither he suggested, she
followed meekly, almost subserviently. And always, she
sought, whenever she could get his attention, his eyes,
and into them she looked for something; but it was ever
something unfathomable she saw therein. But the more
she was unable to fathom those depths, the more her
eagerness to do so became apparent.</p>

<p>She talked of her work as a teacher, she told him then
of her ambition, and her hopes; but Miss Palmer, withal
she felt that day, could not, somehow, impart the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of her great ambition. Vainly she tried, in her most
artful way, to have him tell her something&mdash;something
of himself.</p>

<p>But he never did. That made it harder for Miss
Palmer, for soon, she felt, she just <i>had</i> to know.</p>

<p>"Over there," said she, pointing to a row of new
houses, uniform in splendor, "are homes that are beautiful
and still economical. It is my intention to begin the
purchase of one of them next year. All the people living
there in those houses are personal acquaintances of
mine and friends. And, as you will observe, there is a
school just around the corner, which adds greatly to the
value of the property. I want also to buy another home
in that neighborhood, as soon as I have the first one well
under payment, and so have it paid for by the time my
boy becomes of age."</p>

<p>"Your boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted, with a tired, hard smile.</p>

<p>"Oh...."</p>

<p>"I have been married."</p>

<p>"Oh...."</p>

<p>"But am now a widow."</p>

<p>"Oh...."</p>

<p>"But not by death."</p>

<p>"Oh...."</p>

<p>"No; <i>he</i> is not dead&mdash;at least he wasn't a month ago."
She shrugged her shoulders, and went on now somewhat
doggedly. "I am a grass widow, and you know what
that means...."</p>

<p>He made no answer; but she knew he heard her, and
was listening. She went on as only an unsuccessful and
unhappy woman could. "Yes, when a woman marries a
man that she loves, and gives to him the best that's in
her, and, after years, is forced to give up the fight, her
very heart, for a piece of paper marked 'divorce,' she is
never the same woman she was, and might have continued
to be. There are those who say: 'Oh, I don't
care;' but I'm going to tell you, they do. The woman
lives on apparently gay, but her heart is dead within
her." For a long time now, there was silence. Presently,
she spoke again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am living entirely now for my little boy. He is all
I have, and I am willing, I feel, to slave until the skin
falls from my fingers, that he may have his chance. I am
planning to graduate him as early as possible, and place
him in a good northern school in the study of medicine."</p>

<p>Again Sidney Wyeth felt a peculiarity about his heart.
His thoughts went back into yesterdays, and he recalled
all that he had lived and hoped for, and then for one
brief moment, another stood before him. Miss Palmer
was talking, but her voice seemed to come from far away.
Presently she touched him. He looked up and she saw
the <i>something</i> in his eyes, and suddenly all she had been
feeling passed, as she now observed him closely. Her
lips parted. They started to say: "You strange man.
You've had your troubles too." And then something else
seemed to say: "But you're game, oh you're game.
You've lived a bitter pill, a very bitter pill. Look into
those eyes; study them, and if you have suffered, and
by that suffering you have learned, you can read that a
secret lurks therein; you say nothing, but you feel,
nevertheless." What Miss Palmer did say when her lips
spoke was: "We'd better be going, Mr. Wyeth. It's
getting late. Hear the whistle of the furnace, and across
from that we hear another. That belongs to the Semet
Solvay; but they both are right. It's one o'clock and
thirty minutes. Time to canvass; we must go." Her
voice was kinder now than ever.</p>

<p>They went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Eidder Stuck Up ah She's a Witch</i>"</p>


<p>They now passed between two large industrial plants
of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. To the left,
roaring mightily, was one of the many blast furnaces,
where the pig iron was made from the crude ore. Innumerable
small cars, upon which sat huge ladles, whirled
to and fro. Backward and forward they were pulled, out
of the great shed, where they received their supply of
molten matter from the largest cupolas in existence.
Everywhere the white heat flashed. Hundreds and
thousands of men, black and white (although as they
were now seen, they were all black), worked away.
System was everywhere evident. The cars, with their
loads of molten heat, moved with systematic regularity,
while each and every man seemed to know and fill a
certain place. Only a little carelessness, a little disregard
for established rules and regulation, would lead to death,
of one to a score of men.</p>

<p>To the right of them, filling the hot summer air with
sulphuric and gaseous fumes, the plant of the Semet
Solvay Company was visible in all its activity. It rose
grim and forbidding, with intense heat, and stretched
back for a mile, seemingly, from where they passed.
Even the dirt upon which they walked, as they went
into the quarters between the plants, was hot and dead.
No grass was to be seen. A sickly little short weed
struggled for existence in this medley of industry.</p>

<p>And now, before them rose a hill, at the top of which
were the quarters. High above the factories, as though
seeking the air, and as if to be as much as possible free
from the sulphuric fumes that at times almost stifled
one, these houses stood, dirty, grim and forbidding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
They rose sinister-like in the dull sunlight, and fell back
beyond as they approached.</p>

<p>When the two had reached the summit and viewed the
place closer, Sidney was, for a time, awed by the sight.
Row after row of little red or brown, shell-like homes
they were. With a thin board porch, they made little
resistance against the intense heat, for it seemed hotter
here than elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this hour, the inmates could be seen spread about
on these little porches, if it happened to be on the shady
side; or else, they could be seen in the houses, and some
were even beneath them, anywhere they could find a
spot that would permit of a little rest; for, from one to
three weeks they must work at nights, twelve, thirteen
and fourteen long hours. The furnace cupolas had not
been cool, in many instances, since they were erected,
and only two shifts were employed. They were predominantly
black people.</p>

<p>Only here and there was a mulatto to be seen. Little
children filled the grimy streets, that are made to stink
fearfully from the slag used in the paving. And now, as
the sun beats down, it was soft and stuck to the shoes,
much to the provocation of the walker. Notwithstanding
the apparent lack of comfort, evident everywhere in this
little village of workers, these little black children, with
an occasional Italian, seemed as cheerful and happy and
gay, as those of the aristocrats of the South Highlands.
They played busily, while their little faces, tanned by
the heat, were full of joy. They were as courteous&mdash;more
so than one would expect under the circumstances.</p>

<p>When Sidney Wyeth inquired, he learned that the
T.C.I. company maintains and pays the teachers well
in the schools for the education of these masses of little,
growing human beings. Unfortunately, so torn and frittered
by race law legislation, the city and the county and
the state are far in arrears financially, and, were it left to
those bodies, these little children would not all, by any
means, learn the art of reading and writing; for, with all
our boast as the greatest nation of civilized people, there
is no law here, that compels the parent, guardian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
what more, to send these children to school. Which, perhaps,
accounts for the fact that forty per cent of the
black population are illiterate, and almost as large a
per cent of the whites.</p>

<p>They walked along together in silence, Miss Annie
Palmer and Sidney Wyeth. This silence was interrupted
only when they drew near one or a number of
these little human beings, who smiled upon them, and
made eyes back at Sidney, who winked humorously, and
then made them all happy with a few pennies, for he
loved children. They passed through this mass, which
our pen has attempted to describe, and found themselves
soon in a part given over to nature. Trees had made a
brave fight for the right to exist against poisonous gases,
and some had succeeded, in a measure; while garden
truck, closer to its mother earth, had apparently succeeded
to a still greater degree. Fences were in evidence; pride
as well. The children were cleaner; the houses were not
quarter-shacks any more; but commodious, even large
homes, and were occupied by a class, while workers,
nevertheless they had employed their earnings otherwise
than for liquor and dice, and other frivolities, the curse
that submerges the more ignorant and prideless. They
were a kind people, these were, and when approached
with a suggestion of literature, they smiled and replied:
"We are fond of reading."</p>

<p>Thus Miss Palmer and Sidney Wyeth began work that
day, and until the sun was hurrying toward the west,
they talked and said words of kind sincerity to the many
they met, for these people deserved it. What was more
important, some made effort toward their betterment.
These were few in number. For this reason, such kind
words of encouragement&mdash;ay, very often praise, was
necessary.</p>

<p>So, one by one they subscribed, and hoped for the book
soon, until their orders were many. The evening had
approached until the hour was near six, when they came
upon another, a black woman truly, but pride, apparently,
she had plenty. While not the finest, in point of value,
her house was one of the cosiest. It was painted in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
colors, and reposed quietly behind a medley of small
trees, around which was a fair stand of blue grass. The
lace curtains, all clean and white, contrasted beautifully
behind and below the pale green shades, while within the
furniture was artistically arranged.</p>

<p>They were invited in, and made most welcome. "Yes,"
said the black woman, "I am fond, very fond of good
books, and when it comes to one which my race has
produced, I want it, for such are few. So you may take
my name, and bring the book as soon as you can."</p>

<p>They thanked her profusely, and spoke, as they had
spoken many times that day, kind words of encouragement
and praise. She appreciated it.</p>

<p>Yet some said of this woman, before the two made this
call:</p>

<p>"She's a mean nigger, and you'll neveh be 'vited in da'
house! Um-m! She has no 'commadation 'bout her,
and she's eidder stuck up, ah she's a witch!" Whereupon
they shook their black heads, and went their way
with a mutter.</p>

<p>But 'ere long another&mdash;and he was himself a practical
and successful man&mdash;said: "She's O.K., a fine woman;
but she runs a grocery store while her husband digs coal,
and, well, she doesn't credit Tom, Dick and Harry."
And then Wyeth and his companion understood.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day's work was done at last, and they were hurrying
back to town. They were tired, both mentally and
physically, but their spirits were high. They were, moreover,
grateful, and seemed, to a great degree, to understand
each other. Their friendship has reached the stage
at which they could indulge in confidences, Miss Palmer
especially. She regarded Wyeth, out of her liquid eyes,
and smiled kindly, confidentially. "I'm glad I took up
the work&mdash;now."</p>

<p>She smiled with more confidence than before. "Yes;
I am, really. I have <i>enjoyed</i> it." And still she smiled.
He did too. She smiled back, and then, in a voice that
was so soft, and kind, and confidential, she said: "You
wrote it, didn't you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard the car as it crashed along through the night,
for the sun had set long ago. The trees, for they were
passing through the forest, flashed darkly through the
electric lighted car, and Miss Palmer waited. He did not
reply. After a time&mdash;shall we say minutes&mdash;she sought
his eye. She was languid, and resigned to a degree. "If
you would only admit that which I am positive is true,
it would be so nice. I would truly be satisfied."</p>

<p>"What matter could it make?" and then he stopped.
She might be more interesting curious than otherwise....
He remained silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, why do you maintain this silence regarding the
authorship?" she fretted, moving restlessly about.</p>

<p>"Cannot we go along and sell it&mdash;that, in particular,
is all that matters, isn't it?" He tried to be reasonable.
"You will, as you must now see," he argued, "only need
to go to the <i>industrial</i> people, and success will be yours."
She was oblivious to all this. He resumed, somewhat uncertainly:</p>

<p>"If many people&mdash;especially those in the class to which
I feel you belong&mdash;knew or thought that I am the author
of this book, their possible interest might become doubtful;
whereas, with no thought than the ordinary&mdash;that is
the usual fetish&mdash;they <i>might</i>, after reading it, be much impressed
with its message. Don't you agree with me?"
He wanted to be reasonable, but Miss Palmer was silent.</p>

<p>She was still so when they left the car some minutes
later. When they had reached the curbing and stepped
upon the walk, they saw Hatfield. He had his suit case
and was in somewhat of a hurry, from the strides he was
making.</p>

<p>"Where is he going, home?" inquired Miss Palmer.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the other, "but I wouldn't
think so at least. He never said anything to me in regard
to it, when I left him this morning." Yet so he was,
though he never said so, when they met him and exchanged
a few words.</p>

<p>"I'm going to a friend's house," and he gave Wyeth a
number. They told him of their success, whereupon he
secured a dollar, and that was the last time they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
him. He went back with the same porter they had come
over with.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was Legs who informed Sidney that young Hatfield
was going back to Attalia. Legs was having some experiences
of his own. Before he related them to Wyeth,
he inquired:</p>

<p>"Well, Books, how goes it?" He was cheerful as
usual&mdash;in fact Legs was always cheerful&mdash;with one exception,
which we shall cite presently.</p>

<p>"Fine, Legs," Wyeth beamed. "Couldn't be better,
which is saying a great deal. How's things with you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Could</i> be a whole lot better," he laughed, with dancing
eyes; "but they have been worse. I've been busy
though. Working right along. Got me a gal now, and
won a little change today that I might lose tonight."</p>

<p>He did&mdash;and more. He lost all he had, borrowed a
quarter from Wyeth, wanted a dollar, but Wyeth halted
him, advising that he loaned only to purchase the means
to fill his stomach, and then only when it was begging
for bread.</p>

<p>After this, and for some time to come, Legs' fortune
varied from near prosperity, to going for a whole day
without anything to eat. And at these times, he dispensed
with his usual cheerfulness.</p>

<p>One day, he pawned his meagre jewelry for all he could
obtain thereon, which amounted to only a dollar and a
half. He ate a big meal at a cheap restaurant, got his
shirts from the laundry, paid fifty cents on his room rent,
and went with the remainder to a game. Luck was with
him, as it is with all, once in a while. True, it was only
in a small measure, but he had sufficient to finish paying
his rent, bought a cold lunch that he sensibly tucked
away for future purposes, and went to bed with a dollar
in his pocket.</p>

<p>Sleeping peacefully at two A.M., he was awakened by
John Moore, the man of the house, who told him&mdash;Sidney
heard this&mdash;of a great game close by, and where hundreds
were at stake. So Legs got up, not too cheerfully,
from his comfortable bed and peaceful sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
dressed, and a moment later, followed Moore out into
the night, and to fortune. (?)</p>

<p>He came back in about an hour. He was drunk and
broke, angry with himself, and more so with John Moore.</p>

<p>"Damn that nigger!" he cried terribly, when alone
with Wyeth. "Damn him, damn him, d-a-m-n him!
Came in here and got me out of bed," he roared, brandishing
his long arms. "When I was sleeping the sleep of
peace. 'Nigga's gotta big game on; all kinds a-money.
I'n beat 'm in scan, know I c'n.' And then like a fool," and here
he looked down at himself, as if to see which would be
the best part to kick, "I up and goes with him. Of
course, he must have a drink for himself; so a quarter
first went to 'get him right.' And then to the game.
No sooner had we arrived than 'slip me a haf,' said he,
and like a damn fool I did. He bet a quarter that a
dinge who held the craps wouldn't hit, and lost. He
repeated&mdash;and lost again. He wanted the last quarter,
declaring his luck would begin with it; but I forestalled
him and got the craps myself and threw them dancing,
clear across the table, and they turned up," Wyeth
waited eagerly, "&mdash;craps!"</p>

<p>"Doggone that nigga! 'f he comes around me again,
I'm going to shoot him in the head&mdash;right through the
middle of the head!" And with this solemn declaration,
he went forthwith back to bed. He slept peacefully, and
awakened the following morning, hungry and madder than
ever, as the fact dawned upon him. Wyeth loaned him
a quarter, and gave him some good advice.</p>

<p>"Quit it! Get a job! Work! Honest work! Come to
the room with a book, read and thereby learn something
and save your money!"</p>

<p>"I will, so help me God!" declared the other, feeling
repentant all the way through.</p>

<p>"And remember&mdash;in speaking of the God&mdash;he helps
those who help themselves."</p>

<p>"My father was a preacher!"</p>

<p>Wyeth made no further comment; but Legs was a
good rustler. He did better&mdash;for a while. He looked
the town from end to end for the kind of work he followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
but without success. So it continued, day after day, his
great problem was to get something to fill that stomach,
which was now flabby, very much so at times. He
managed, by diligent application, to drop something into
it once and sometimes twice a day, and one night he
came to the room with an exclamation, that he had
eaten three times that day, and had a dime left in his
pocket. He drew this forth, balanced it on the tip of his
forefinger, observed it long and earnestly, and then said:
"Little one, we are friends, it's true, but such we cannot
possibly remain; for tomorrow you will have to go
the way of the rest," whereupon he touched his stomach
with the forefinger of his other hand. "So, tonight, on
a pilgrimage of fortune we must go, you and I. It's
more or less&mdash;possibly nothing. So, to the first crap
game I take thee. And once there in the glare, I shall
risk you against the rest. Therefore, little one, prepare
thyself, for soon I shall bet thee, understand, in the first
crap game I come to, a nickel at a time."</p>

<p>He did&mdash;and won. He continued then for some time
to win and win, and resumed all the cheerfulness he once
possessed. His winnings continued until he had redeemed
his jewelry, paid a week's room rent in advance, was
clean, and seven dollars to the good over all. Then it
began to go the other way. He quit, however, and deposited
five dollars with his friend Wyeth.</p>

<p>"I'm doing this," said he, "because these roomers,
who shoot craps too, would not allow me to be otherwise
than broke." Thus the fortune of Legs took a turn for
the good, for one day. The next night he went broke.
Thus we will leave him for the present, and return to
Sidney Wyeth and Miss Annie Palmer, who sold books.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FIVE_2" id="CHAPTER_FIVE_2"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>A Bigger Liah They Ain't in Town</i>"</p>


<p>John Smith was a large man, fat, and big-hearted as
well, so Wyeth had been told previously. Sidney met
both Smith and his wife, and she was larger still. She,
too, was a good, kind woman, with a multitude of friends
whom they had made by kindness to others. She was a
full blood, while he was not more than half. Together
they would weigh to exceed five hundred pounds. And,
of course, he was a preacher.</p>

<p>Said he, when he had heard the story of <i>The Tempest</i>:
"Yes, I'll take one&mdash;no, you may put me down for two."
And then he seated himself with as much comfort as was
possible upon the greasy counter, for John Smith was a
successful merchant, who made his living by the sale of
necessities, to a multitude of his clan, who were employed
by the Semet Solvay Company. As he made the above
remark, he was ready, as we can see, for a long conversation.</p>

<p>"Been takin' many odah's?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of them," the other replied, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"M-m. Who all yu' got in that list?" he went on.</p>

<p>The other shoved it before him.</p>

<p>"M-m," said he, running his eyes over the order list.
"See yu' have Lem Jackson down he' fo' one."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other; "seems to be quite a fine
fellow," he commented.</p>

<p>"M-m; but a bigger liah they ain't in town." He
was not much excited by the statement, and went on
calmly: "He's fine all right, though&mdash;to drink whiskey.
M-m. Fight 'n' steal, and lay around drunk, and go
regularly to jail, and likewise have somebody pay him
out. I have done so myself, a few times, 's why I happen
t' know. M-m. Two times in succession I have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
that in the last thirty days. M-m; but the next time
he gets his black hide in there, in so fo' 's I'm concerned,
he c'n stay. Yeh, 'n' 'twouldn't 'sprise me 'f the officers
didn' come rid'n up at any time fo' 'im, 'cause 'es been
actin' mighty suspicious the last few days. I'n bet he's
been int' somethin'."</p>

<p>"Heah! Heah!" he cried, jumping from the counter
and hurrying to the platform in front, "what'n the devil
you all makin' all this he' noise 'bout!"</p>

<p>"O-oh, uncle," cried a little one, grasping his trousers
and looking up, "the p'lice uz jes' gone ova the hill wi'
Lem Jackson. Dey has 'rested 'im fo' stealin' coppa
wiah."</p>

<p>Sadly, Wyeth drew his pencil through a name he had
written not an hour before.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to get your opinion concerning these, Elder,"
he said gratefully. "The ones we have had down here
have been pretty good, and I don't wish to be cherishing
expectations that are not likely to be realized. So tell
me, if you don't mind, who can be relied on."</p>

<p>"Aw, I do'n mind," he rumbled; "'cause them that's
all right is all right; and them that ain't, ain't. So whateve'
I tell you 's all the same in the end, exceptin' you
won't need t' build on them that ain't.</p>

<p>"These people who had oh'd, 'n' took the' books so
readily, 'n' did'n' haf t' wait fo' pay day, ah, among the
good people we got out he', that's the reason." He took
the paper from Wyeth's hand, and, pointing out the
names, he began:</p>

<p>"He's Joe Sim's now, I see you have, 's as good as gold.
You c'n count that book delivered; also I see you have
Tom Hutchis, 'n' 'es O.K. Jerry Carter is also; but
here's Joe Tuttle, outside-a Lem Jackson, a bigger liah,
gambler&mdash;tin horn gambler, never lived; 'n' he caint
read, why has he subscribed fo' the book?" The other
looked at the name, and then said:</p>

<p>"I think Miss Palmer took that order."</p>

<p>"Aw, that's it. He's chivalrous, all right, and would
be gallant enough to subscribe to anything a woman's
carrying around; but he won't be man 'nough t' take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
it, 'n' he knows it." At this point he laid the list down,
stuck his big stomach forward, rested his hands thereupon,
and with his finger to emphasize, he forthwith
gave Wyeth a lecture on Negroology.</p>

<p>"I been runnin' this sto' heah fo' thoiteen yeahs, 'n'
lemme tell y', brother, I know these nigga's fo' what
they is." He paused a moment, and surveyed the list
again, critically. Then, laying it down, said: "Jump up
on the counter and rest yo'se'f, I gotta story t' tell yu'."
Wyeth obeyed, and John Smith began.</p>

<p>"I was run outta Geo'gi', 'n' I ain' 'shame to admit it;
but notwithstandin' the fact, 'twas a mistake 'n' aftwa'd
the whi' people found it out 'n' was sorry, 'n' wanted me
t' return. That, however, was afta I was ove' he' 'n'
doin' business, 'n' mo' bus'ness than I had eve' done
befo'. So I jes' thanked them fo' admittin' to the mistake,
'n' stay's he'. Well, 's I was sayin', I came ove'
he' 'n' sta'ted a sto'. I had owned a big fa'm back the'
in Geo'gi', 'n' I received $10,000 fo' it 'n' put's most uv
it in th' sto' 'n' trusted cullud people. In three ye's I's
broke&mdash;flat broke. Did'n' have nothin' but my credit.
I had opened that sto' wi' the finest stock of eve'thing:
Clothing, boots 'n' shoes, groceries 'n' hardware, 'n' 's
I said, trusted my people.</p>

<p>"Now a nigga, with rare exceptions, will not pay 'n'
hones' debt, oh, no! He'll lie, 'n' lie, 'n' lie! T' make a
long story sho't, they lied me outta bus'ness. So I
broke, but wi' plenty sense, I sta'ted all ove' agin, wi'
the help of the Lawd 'n' the whi' people, what knowed
I was hones' 'n' ambitious.</p>

<p>"That was ten yeah's ago. Seven ye's ago I made a
'rangement wi' the Semet Solvay Company t' give these
da'kies credit, and th' company has since then, held the
amount from the' pay envelope. From then on I began
to climb, but I had a drawback that was like a tick in
my shirt, but I'll git t' that later. Now nobody c'n say
I gets my money by holding up these nigga's, either;
fo' I gives 's much 'n' mo' fo' th' money than does the
average sto' keeper 'bout he'.</p>

<p>"And so, with the help a th' Lawd, and a good wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
I have now twenty-nine houses 'n' lots, 'n' a little money
besides. And he' comes the drawback I sta'ted t' speak
uv. Eve' week that comes ove' my head, I mus' spend
good money t' get some a these low-down big mouth
nigga's outta jail. Last ye', 'n' you wouldn't b'lieve it,
but I spent nine hund'd dollahs a-gettin' nigga's outta
jail, 'n' this ye' promises t' exceed that."</p>

<p>"But why will you pay their fines?" exclaimed the
other. "Why don't you let the skunks stay and work
it out?"</p>

<p>"That's it! That's it!" he exclaimed, moving about
on the counter. "I swear at the end of each ye' that I
ain' go'n pay another fine, but they pr'ceed diligently t'
get locked up, 'n' I, bye and bye, comes fo'th wi' the long
green 'n' pays'm out.</p>

<p>"Now he's a incident uv it: Take this heh Lem
Jackson, fo' instance. A low-down o'nry hound, it would
be a blessing t' this dirty little district 'f he was in his
grave; but the troubles comes by him not being there.
So he, on earth a-runnin' a-roun'; but wi' a family&mdash;a
wife 'n' chillun a-hollerin' fo' bread.</p>

<p>"It comes 'bout by his wife, who was one a-the finest
girls in this burg when he married her. So yu'n see,
when he pr'ceeds t' git drunk, 'n' drunk right, understand,
'n' then gets t' squabblin' wi' some other no count
nigga, 'n' gets run in, who's affected?"</p>

<p>The other winced.</p>

<p>"It's the same wi' dozens of the others. I'd let them
stay in there 'n' rot, so fo' 's they is concerned; but t'
me comes a cry'n wife, 'n' a-string-a hongry kids, so I
goes 'n' bails the devil out." He paused a moment now
to breathe a spell. "'Cassionally," he resumed, "I c'n,
with some 'nfluence I have with the judge, get some out
without payin' a fine; but th' lawyer must have his,
anyhow, 'n' a nigga, 's I done already said, would'n' pay
the Lo'd Jesus when he's out; but promises to bring eve'
dime he makes t' you when he's in.</p>

<p>"So, the're my bu'den, come day, go day. Over
theah, fo' 'nuther instance, stands a nigga&mdash;see him?
The one that's so drunk 'n' noisy? I got him out las'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
week, when he had received two hund'd days on th'
gang, 'n' t'day I got his brother out who was locked up
Friday."</p>

<p>"Why can they not keep out of so much trouble?"
said Wyeth seriously.</p>

<p>"Whiskey. The minute they get the' pay, the first
thing they wants is whiskey, 'n' then a crap game."</p>

<p>"And women," said Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other; "but they won't spend any
money on them; no, that would in one sense, be too
much like right."</p>

<p>"What per cent of them, do you think, who, after
giving their word as a bond, would stand to it, a promise,
you understand?"</p>

<p>"I'm 'shame t' admit it, I'm 'shame t' admit it; but,
honestly, I wouldn't estimate that more than two out of
ten could be trusted to keep their word, other than t'
buy a pint a whiskey, or shoot dice until they did'n'
have a dime."</p>

<p>"What effect is the white man's prejudice having upon
him directly?" Wyeth inquired.</p>

<p>"None! None! In the days of old, and even yet, the
white man's prejudice was very hindersome; but, as
time has wore on, and the races have come to expect
each other as they know they will be, the prejudice of
the white man is not near so hindersome as some a ouh
people would have you b'lieve it. Of co'se," he added
thoughtfully, "politic's is in a way denied him; but a great
many more can vote than they do if they would pay the'
poll taxes. All in all, you'll find so much ignorance, and
ignorance by preference among them, and their minds are
so polluted with the devil, until politic's as they are now,
would not make much difference. I sometimes shudder
when I look around me and listen, to conclude what the
race is sometime coming to."</p>

<p>"You have a large number of churches, a hundred odd,
I think. That should act as a great feature toward the
moral evolution."</p>

<p>"Very little, very little," he returned, shaking his
head sadly. "For this reason: The churches, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
having, of course, many good men as their pastors, are
filled up with more grafters, it seems, and mean rascals
as well, until the calling is not fulfilled. I don't hesitate
t' say that there are more grafters among the preachers,
than any other profession among the colored people in
this town. And the Baptists have, and still are, building
so many little churches, until every dime available, and
unavailable too, is used fo' this purpose, instead of some
means to help the chillun."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, figuratively speaking, that there
are too many Negro churches?"</p>

<p>"'Course the' is, a-course. Why there are more than
seventy Baptist churches among Negroes in the town
alone. That in itself, is an example of the utter selfishness
tha' p'vails heh."</p>

<p>"How does it come about? It seems to me that the
organization of the church system must be very loose, to
permit of such a wholesale building of churches all the
time. It would seem advisable that if they had fewer
churches, with better conduct in the administration of
those few, more good would result."</p>

<p>"Well, the Baptists are dominated, to some extent, by
the association, but it is inadequate in many ways. For
instance, when they rule a pastor out, he claims to a
handful of devouts and friends, that he has been made
the goat of a frame-up, starts him a church in some
shack, or any other place where he can concentrate a
few shouters, and continues."</p>

<p>"And what effect does all this have upon the children?"</p>

<p>He held up his hand in despair. "Brother, brother!
That is the sad part. The colored child in this town is
lucky, 'f he becomes anything else but a criminal before
he does anything else. His surroundings 'n'&mdash;what's
that other thing?" he stopped short, and held his hand
to his head.</p>

<p>"Environment?"</p>

<p>"That's it! His 'nvironment is so bad. He is surrounded
by eve' thing conducive t' crime 'n' degeneration.
He sees, hears, 'n' is brought in contact, in his
eve' day life, with all that is evil, 'n' learns t' drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
whiskey befo' he gets into pants. And now, instead of
the Negro churches concentrating their efforts toward
the raising of the child, they put all the fo'ce into the
preacher's lungs, trying t' convert ole sinnahs that
nothin' but hell itse'f will effect."</p>

<p>"A library, and Y.M.C.A., properly conducted, might
have some effect for the good, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"A dead investment fo' yeahs t' come, fo' the reason
that they would have no incentive to attend either.
Without clean, intelligent parents, 'n' better conducted
churches, such cannot fulfill the purpose."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better be going?" called Miss Palmer at
this moment. "It's getting late."</p>

<p>The two shook hands as they parted. As Sidney went
over the hill, that sloped for a long way down to the
car line, he did not seem to hear Miss Palmer, and he
answered her mechanically.</p>

<p>He was thinking, thinking of what he had learned, in
the last hour, from John Smith, merchant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SIX_2" id="CHAPTER_SIX_2"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>Yes&mdash;Miss Latham</i>"</p>


<p>Three weeks had passed since Mildred Latham first
saw the city she now called home. She considered it the
only home she ever really had; because she had in one
person a friend, such as she had never felt she would
have. That friend was Constance Jacobs. Daily, they
went forth together in their work, which was the sale of
<i>The Tempest</i>. There was another, who was, apparently,
a friend also. That was Wilson Jacobs&mdash;but more of him
later.</p>

<p>Where there is congeniality, understanding and sympathy,
there is happiness to a degree. When such is the
case, every day&mdash;despite even an arduous task, within
itself, becomes a holiday. Such were the days which
Mildred Latham experienced. Constance was like a
sister. One of those rare creatures, whose happiness
came in her honest and sincere desire, to see that others
were happy about her. She had found Mildred a girl
secretive to an unfathomable degree, and, to say the least,
strange; but withal, a personality, and a sympathy that
was so sincere, even devout, that she loved her more
than her own soul. That affection seemed to grow and
become more apparent when she saw, slowly but truly,
nevertheless, a cloud lifting from the brow of the girl
who came to her door in quest of lodging, not long since.</p>

<p>"Wilson," said she one day, "do you know, can you
appreciate how much it means to one to please somebody;
to make one feel happy, relieved, and in turn, see
that person, come to know her, and see how genuinely
she can, in turn, appreciate what one does?"</p>

<p>"You are dealing in riddles today, Constance. I don't
understand; but I will guess. Is it Mil&mdash;Miss Latham?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>Miss</i> Latham," whereupon she smiled upon
him, and then looked away.</p>

<p>"Yes," she resumed, looking out of the window upon
a small garden she was trying to further, "it is she. I
think if I know her until the end of my days, there will
always be something strange&mdash;something I do not&mdash;can
never understand; but, in addition to showing a kind
regard for the little things it pleases one's heart to do,
she makes me so happy."</p>

<p>"She keeps me puzzled," said Wilson. "I can never
make up my mind about her. She is indeed a mystery.
I do not, as I can see, have any clue in guessing who she
is&mdash;and what she is, nor can I even conjecture. She is a
lady. But as you say, and have said before, there is
something about her that one can never understand."
He was thoughtful. Presently he heard his sister.</p>

<p>"She is an excellent saleswoman, although I do not
think she was selling the book until she came here. I
have not asked her. She is one of these people who,
while not forbidding approach, yet her manner does not
invite questioning. But she is a business woman&mdash;girl.
I cannot come to see her as a girl, and yet, in the sense
we know her, she is not a woman."</p>

<p>"I finished the book. That young man had an extraordinary
experience, to say the least," said Wilson.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carroll has finished the copy I sold him, but his
sympathies are not altogether with the pioneer; he
criticises him."</p>

<p>"How's that? Oh, yes, I understand. I have heard
the same thing from others. They see it; that the
pioneer should have seen the evil and insincerity of the
preacher, and should have governed his happiness accordingly.
Yes," he went on, "but the pioneer <i>did</i> see that
the preacher meant no good; he was aware, fully aware
that he was about to become the victim of an intrigue.
But regardless of this fact, it must be appreciated, that
if this grave incident had not come to pass in the life
of that young man, we would not now have the book.
Men do not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And women."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course," he smiled, "write that kind of book
unless their lives have met with extreme reverses; something
in their souls has gone amiss, and, as a last resort&mdash;I
can't quite find the words to explain it; but it&mdash;what
they write&mdash;is a brief of the soul; while the public is the
court, and to this court, as in the common court of the
land, they cry out for justice, restitution."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Constance, "whoever this Lochinvar is,
and regardless of his misfortunes, writing the book has
made one person happy. That person is Mildred Latham.
The book is her hobby. I would give something to learn
why she is so wrapped up in the work; but it gives her
more pleasure, I am sure, to show it to someone, and tell
them the story a dozen times a day, than it does some of
those levee Negroes to get drunk. And the work, she is
simply lost in it. She makes the six work days of the
week seem like one, with her cheerful enthusiasm. The
very life in itself seems to please her. To make readers
out of multitudes who've never given reading a second
thought, seems to be her great ambition. She succeeds,
too. And at the end of such days, more than at any
other time, she is like I fancy her to be: Feminine,
lovable, sympathetic&mdash;human in all its depths."</p>

<p>"We certainly struck it rich when she condescended to
play for the choir. And she can seem to get more out of
the organ than anyone has heretofore."</p>

<p>"She sings too. I never knew that she could sing so
sweetly, until she led last Sunday, when Bernice Waverly
was ill."</p>

<p>"She almost made me forget my text."</p>

<p>"She's coming now," whispered Constance, as, upon
the narrow walk, a familiar footfall sounded. Presently
the screen slammed lightly behind the one of their conversation.</p>

<p>"I've been clear to the river, walked all the way there
and back. Thirty blocks in all," she cried cheerfully,
surveying both, smilingly.</p>

<p>"And after all the walking you did today in delivering!"
Constance remonstrated softly. "You mustn't
overdo your good health, dear. We would both be ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>ribly
upset if you were taken down in any way. Did you
know that?" The other was taken by surprise. She
was plainly embarrassed for a moment, and to dismiss it
she plucked childlike at her skirts. Presently she said
lightly:</p>

<p>"Always saying something, Constance." And suddenly
she flew into the caress of the other. "I haven't become
used to such words, yet, and you'll have to be careful in
using them. Because," and here she buried her head
against the other's shoulder, "I might be likely to boo-hoo."
The three laughed it away now.</p>

<p>"Constance tells me, Miss Latham," said Wilson,
"that you are an agent, sophisticated in all the arts that
result in a sale." His eyes now sought hers with unfeigned
admiration.</p>

<p>"Constance is, too; and did she not mention herself?"
She rated Constance now the least bit severely. "You
never give yourself credit for anything. Why don't
you?" She frowned, but it was too grateful&mdash;her appearance&mdash;to
be accepted seriously.</p>

<p>"How many copies are both of you delivering weekly
now?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"We delivered eighty-seven this week so far, and forty-five
last week," replied Mildred, sitting very close to his
sister on a small settee.</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought, Mildred," said Constance,
"that selling a book, or anything, for that matter, is a
task within itself, calling always for initiative. The
average person has not the courage, at least he has not
practiced it, that would make a salesman or saleswoman.
All of us, with possibly a few exceptions, are chattels,
human chattels. The ordinary person would stand on
his head on a nail for an hour, if someone told him that
was right; whereas, to take upon himself the task of
leading anything, he is an utter failure."</p>

<p>"Constance is psychological today, don't you think?"
smiled her brother; but Mildred accepted the words
seriously and listened for more. Constance had a turn
of logic, and was in the habit, Mildred had learned, of
saying some very serious things at times; although she
could not be regarded as entirely serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is why I think you are so successful, Mildred,"
she went on. "You seem to be possessed with initiative;
it seems a part of your construction; you seem charged
with it; and, in addition to this, is your kind regard and
appreciation, for another's point of view."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't tell me so many nice things. I can't
believe it; I have never seen myself in the way you
speak of, and if you persist, dear," and her smile upon
Constance was the softest, "you might make me vain&mdash;and
I would almost rather be anything than vain&mdash;and
spoil it all. Here!" She kissed her a long lingering kiss,
and then flew to her room.</p>

<p>"Wilson," said his sister, when they were alone again,
"when I think of the young man and his experiences in
the story, and his make-up and point of view, I find
myself connecting Mildred. She fills my dreams in that
story as the One Woman. How successful and how happy
that man could have been, had he had a treasure like her,
for his own."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, possibly. No doubt; but if, taking the
story as it is, if he had her now, after what has come to
pass, I judge he could appreciate her real worth to a
greater degree. Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>She was thoughtful a moment before replying. "Yes,
I think I do. It <i>would</i> be different now." She was
reflective for some time before she went on again. "The
other day I said to her: 'If you had been in the
girl's place in the story, how would you have accepted
this father?' I shall not soon forget how strange she
looked. Her entire being seemed to undergo a change.
From the way I recall it, her mind seemed to go back
into the past, and she was so odd for a few seconds, that
I was sorry I said it. Then, after a moment, during
which she seemed to struggle with something, she said:
'I would not, you may be sure, have been like the girl.'
That was all, and I said no more; nor do I think I will
again. She acted&mdash;ah, I can't hardly frame it; but,
frankly, too peculiar."</p>

<p>"I'm going to bed, Sis'," said her brother now. His
eyes were evidence that he should go. He was awake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
now for a moment. "I've been much interested in what
has passed tonight, Sis'. I'll be glad to talk on the same
subject again." He was silent a moment, and then,
rising, he said, "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Wilson."</p>

<p>Then she heard his door close, after watching him
until he reached his door; after that, she fell into deep
and serious thinking. It concerned him. He was all she
had&mdash;this brother&mdash;and his future was in her thoughts
now, a grave concern of hers. Yes, and Wilson Jacobs
was now one and thirty.... He had no wife&mdash;not even
did he see women in that sense. Constance didn't think
of herself now&mdash;nor at any other time, apparently.
And yet she was twenty-eight; but she felt, if her brother
was to be a happy man, he should consider his life more
seriously. He was lost in his purpose. Mildred Latham
was a girl, the kind of girl she would like to see him
take notice of.</p>

<p>And then she was jerked back into a sudden reminder....
Wilson <i>had</i> been acting different lately. How could
she, for one moment, have forgotten it. Yes, he had
been acting <i>very</i> differently.... He was all attention
when Mildred was saying anything. He was careful never
to disturb her. And only tonight, when they had spoken
of her together, he had almost called her by her first
name.</p>

<p>Constance Jacobs was now oblivious to what was
about her. She continued to think. Mildred was kind,
she was intelligent; she was&mdash;and here Constance forgot
the words Mildred had said not an hour before, 'I cannot
stand vanity'&mdash;beautiful.</p>

<p>She retired presently, but it was sometime before she
went to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SEVEN_2" id="CHAPTER_SEVEN_2"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>It All Falls Right Back on Society</i>"</p>


<p>"Two Negroes killed yesterday in the city, is the
homicide record for this town, which makes thirteen
killed in the last week," said Wilson Jacobs the following
morning, as he laid the paper down to take up his knife
at breakfast. "Every day, at least, it is almost every
day, there is a murder of each other by our people in this
town. Saturday night or Sunday usually sees four or
five such crimes."</p>

<p>"Isn't it deplorable?" breathed Mildred, seating herself
at the other side. "What accounts, Mr. Reverend"&mdash;she
somehow found it awkward to call him Reverend&mdash;"Jacobs,
for such acts, that is, such is to be expected;
but why does there happen to be so much of it here?"</p>

<p>"Ignorance&mdash;lack of intelligence in our people. This
city has a preponderance of ignorant, polluted people
among the Negroes. They flock into this town from all
around, and represent the low, polluted, and depraved
element of our race. They settle about the levee district,
spend their earnings for the worst whiskey, give the
remainder of their time to gambling and all forms of
vice, and murder is the natural consequence."</p>

<p>"Is there no way, there are so many churches, it would
seem that so many places of worship would have a good
effect upon these people?" said the other anxiously.</p>

<p>"More than a hundred Negro churches in this town;
but they are, for the most part, churches only. Seventy
of these are Baptist, and they are building more right
along."</p>

<p>"I meet it every day in my work," she said. "Always
so many apparently good women, mothers and daughters,
sisters, who say: 'I sho would lak t' have that book,
but y' see, it's lak this. We's building a new chu'ch;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
or, a rally is on next Sunday, 'n' all the women is axed
t' give five dollars 'n' the men ten,' etc. and etc. But
that is not the most I hear; it is: 'Lawd, Lawd, honey,
yu' sweet li'l chile. I sho is sorry to disappint you.
I sho is. You walkin' way up heh 'n' bringin' tha' book;
but don' you know, honey, that low down nigga man a
mine went off Sat'dy night un got drunk, got t' fightin'
and was 'rested. I did'n' pay no 'tention when 'e did'n'
show up a-Sat'dy night; nor was I wo'ied Sunday; but
when Monday mawnin' come 'n' no nigga, den I knowed
de p'lice done got dat nigga. And dey had, Sat'dy night
fo' fightin' 'n' 'sturbin de peace. So I done took yo'
money, honey, 'n' got dat nigga out. 'n' now, honey, I
jes' cain' say when I'll be ready, 'cause 'e done lost his
job, too, so that means I gotta take ceh' a both uv us.'"</p>

<p>"If we allow our minds to dwell too long on it, frankly,
Miss Latham," said he, "we will become discouraged.
Where ignorance is bliss, it may be folly to be wise; but
it is unprofitable, from a moral point of view. So, as
long as we have a preponderance of ignorance, just so
long are we going to have a dreadful homicide record in
this, and other towns."</p>

<p>"I read an editorial in the paper recently, with regard
to murder and the record per city," said Miss Latham.
"I see that the south leads. And this town and Effingham
seem to struggle for the lead of them all. It was
not decided as to which had the most, but it stated that
more people were murdered in either one of them than in
any other city in the world, regardless of population."</p>

<p>"And that is not all. In both of these cities, no data
is kept of the number the police kill. I know policemen
personally, and see them on duty, who have killed as
many as half a dozen Negroes."</p>

<p>"Oh, be merciful!" she cried. "Can this really be
so?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> so," he maintained. "Why last week I stopped
a few days in Effingham on the way from Attalia, and
read on the front page of one of the leading papers, and
which was accompanied by a cut, that an old policeman,
who had seen twenty-five years on the force, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
had recently been made a captain, had never killed a
man. It was this fact, obviously, that was the most
extraordinary."</p>

<p>"Cannot the city government do more toward the
suppression of so much crime?" she asked, forgetting to
eat her breakfast.</p>

<p>"They cannot to any great extent, because it is the
task of society. The very foundation upon which this
crime rests, is due to ignorance on the part of the masses.
You cannot reason with a mind that has no training.
Have you ever seen it that way?" he asked, more serious
now than she had ever seen him before, notwithstanding
he was a serious person.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"No one can, the law of the land cannot. It all falls
right back on society." He was too serious now for a
time to say anything, and he ate his meal with his face
contracted in serious thought. Presently he said: "I
am a minister of the gospel, and have the highest regard
for the Presbyterian faith; but, honestly, when I see
the Baptists with their loose system, keeping the black
population that make up their body, and with little,
almost no effort whatever toward the education of the
children, and when I see still further, the Methodists
with their better system, in that they are not held back
so much by 'splitters,' I sometimes regret that the world
took Martin Luther seriously. For, say what they will,
the conduct of the Catholics in regard to the children,
marriage and divorce, has an encouraging result in our
civic life."</p>

<p>"I believe that if there were a Christian movement
here as there is in the northern cities, Y.M.C.A. and
libraries, and if those who are leaders of the race would
encourage the patronage of these places, eventually, it
would result to the public's good," she said, after some
thought.</p>

<p>"Only one place in the south, as yet, seems to be
making any effort along such Christian lines. And you
would not believe it, but the greatest barrier to this has
been the preachers. In their church effort, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the people fairly well under control, but to their own end.
In Attalia, they have almost come to appreciate the fact,
that a more intelligent and cleaner populace reacts to
the welfare of the church. Everything seems favorable
toward getting one."</p>

<p>"I am sure that would make a great difference in
time," said she, heartily. "In Cincinnati, they expect
to begin one soon. They have almost all the subscriptions
in now." She was silent for a time, and then
pursued: "Do you not think such a movement could
be stimulated here?"</p>

<p>"Not at the present, I think, regardless of the great
need of one, and of the great good it could do. It will be
some time before the preachers would come to lend their
support&mdash;in fact, I do not think it could be expected
until they have been shown, in a majority, that such
would react for the good of all."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" cried Constance, entering at this moment,
"you two appear to have worked yourself into a frenzy
of excitement." She surveyed both, questioningly.</p>

<p>"We have," her brother replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Where Are You From?</i>"</p>


<p>Mildred worked hard that day. As she went from the
rear of one house to another, she studied the people she
met, more seriously than she had done before. By this
time, her work had become automatic, and she did not
find it hard or monotonous, to say the same thing over
and over again. She had, moreover, become accustomed
to the class of people among whom she worked. She liked
it now, and for more than one reason; but perhaps the
greatest reason, was because it brought her into the
closest contact with humanity, without regard to conventionality.
The people she met daily, with few exceptions,
made no attempt to be conventional. They
were human, almost all of them. She met them in their
vocations; she studied their environment. Some she
saw, grown people with families, but themselves like
children. They gave their word with apparent sincerity,
and did not make any more effort to keep it than the
merest babe. Why did they not? She asked this question,
and then studied them carefully for the answer. It was
ignorance. It amused her to find so many who were
positive they did not want it, did not even read, so how
could they use it? "But you can read?" she would
inquire. "Sho!" would invariably come the answer.
Then came argument. Force of reason on her part, and
sometimes, she guiltily felt, it was by force of argument
they were induced to buy. She now paid little attention
when they remarked that they did not want the book.
Obviously, since the most stubborn ones were, very often
after argument, the most appreciative buyers, she found
it reasonable to ignore their words of objection.</p>

<p>Mildred's life was a diversion that was much to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
liking. She was learning the greatest lesson a woman
could learn&mdash;the study of human nature.</p>

<p>On Sunday, when she met others (Wilson Jacobs'
church had for its members the more thoughtful and
respectable Negro element), she was the recipient of
many surprised expressions. They were, she invariably
found, surprised that she canvassed among the servant
class. She did not appraise them of the practical side
of it; in fact, of the masses, these were more able to buy.
She saw, as the Sundays went by, that much of the
display was a pretense. Many of those who expressed
such surprise were themselves unwilling to buy a book.
Always she found (and especially among the teachers,
whom she thought the most pretentious) some artful
excuse. Most of them had a library which contained
many books, but few by their own race. They had the
works of a poet who had died some years ago; they also
had a copy of a book or so by the principal of Tuskegee.
And then, one day she learned, from a most reliable and
unbiased source: "That those people bought the works
of the now dead poet, because his name had become a
fetish. The white people had accepted these men's work
and called them great. Therefore, the Negroes had
accordingly followed suit. So the Negro author must
first get a white audience, which will laud the greatness
of his pen, and then the Negroes will buy, calling the
book great also."</p>

<p>Miss Latham found conditions thus, and governed her
work accordingly. But, as time went on, she met surprises.
They did not buy <i>The Tempest</i>, but they read it.
She found it borrowed among them all. They never
offered to buy it, but they read it nevertheless.</p>

<p>She did not understand this at first.</p>

<p>So she found the masses, often amusing, to say the
least, but often with more active race regard. They
had the many faults of ignorance; easy to influence into
giving an order, they were still more ready to back out,
lie out of taking it. Some of those who took orders, and
even the books, did not read, she learned. While others
could read, but did not; but when she told them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the story, the story of her hero, for now she held him
thus, they were all thrilled, and inspired. Thus it happened
that many bought the book because it was by a
Negro, and said as much.</p>

<p>Mildred Latham succeeded in her work. And with her
success, there came to her each day, almost every hour,
thoughts of the one of her dreams. This day, and others
as well, she shuddered when she could not forget what
he had been told. It was worse, and more, because he
had been told the truth. It hurt her. He was somewhere,
and he didn't know that she loved him; but,
even if he did, he could not accept this knowledge with
any delight. No, he was out of her life, or, rather, she
was out of his. He would never, no never, be out of hers.
Never, because, as she felt every day, it was his memory
that stimulated her, made her feel and appreciate what
great good a life can do. And she did all she could, in
her way, to assist others. Some day, maybe, she might
be able to do more.</p>

<p>When she undressed each night to retire, she fell on
her knees and offered thanks to Him that is Holy. She
asked for strength and conviction and courage to continue
in the same on the morrow. She struggled to lead
a Christian life, and to be acceptable in the eyes of her
Creator.... She was a believer.</p>

<p>Mildred was welcomed everywhere, and treated with
all the courtesy due to a lady. When she left a house
one day, where two women had given her their order,
she overheard them say she was beautiful. She felt her
heart throbbing. She was not vain, but she loved to be
called attractive. Then she thought of him. He had
called her beautiful also. She wondered whether he, at
any time, forgot the words he heard, and remembered
her as he had seen her that day. The day they had
danced and he&mdash;kissed her. She seemed to feel still that
kiss; she hoped to feel it always. She wondered, if he
knew she was working in his memory and made happy
thereby, would he be pleased&mdash;and would he, at least,
try to forget as much as he could what he had been told.
He could, of course, not forget. That made it hard.
<i>She did not expect him to forget.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>When the day's work was done, and she had returned
to her place of abode, she lay upon her bed, and for a
time, she gave up to thoughts of him. She knew not
where he was. She did not try to find out, that would
make it worse. Sometimes she felt that if she did, perhaps,
it might help her in her picture of him; then
again, she did not think it best. That might bring him
too conspicuously before her. Sometimes at night she
would suddenly awaken, and her very soul would be on
fire. She sat up at these times, and almost declared it
could not go on this way. She must know his whereabouts;
he must feel, know that she loved him. And
then, when the spell had died&mdash;was killed, for its death
was inevitable, she would lie down again and try to forget.
But she never succeeded in this.</p>

<p>More than a month had passed since she came hither.
She had, with the assistance of Constance, sold more
than three hundred copies of the book. She had saved
the greater part of her earnings. She wondered, one day,
as she left a Negro bank, where she kept it, what he
would think of her, if he could know. She saw him
viewing her in many ways, as she was now. But always
she was left undecided. Never would what he had been
told, seem to leave her free and undisturbed.</p>

<p>One day she returned home very much excited. She
didn't let Constance see her though. She had an adventure
that day. She encountered a man who looked
at her strangely, when she was offering the book. She
had seen him in Cincinnati; and she recognized him by
a scar on his forehead; but she had not known this
until she looked into his face, and asked him to give her
his order. Then he started. Did he recognize her? She
thought not, because she had not known he ever saw her,
when he used to pass by the house in Cincinnati, where
she then lived. When she recognized him this day, she
had bungled in her talk. This fact made him suspicious.
He regarded her with undisguised curiosity. Presently
his face cleared, and he said: "You remind me of a girl
I once used to see and know in Cincinnati. Where are
you from?" She tried to ignore this question; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
pretended not to hear him. Despite this effort, she
choked. He observed it, and was convinced that she
was the one he had seen and known. Then she was
frightened, and, of course, did the worst thing she could
have done. She asked to be excused, and forthwith fled.
She had not gone many steps when she heard him mutter:
"Well, I'll be damned!" And still before she got beyond
the sound of his voice, she heard him again: "The
same. Wonder what kind of a game she is playing here.
Books. Hump! Well I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>She didn't canvass any more that day. She couldn't.
She was too nervous and afraid. Then she was upset
for other days. She feared to meet him. She could
never again stand that gaze of suspicion. All that she
had lived suddenly stood before her when she recalled it.
Night came, and she retired early. The incident persisted
in her memory. She was exhausted, and then
she did what any unhappy girl is most likely to do.
She cried all night.</p>

<p>Even if she felt Sidney Wyeth had closed the chapter
of her in his life, she wanted him. She <i>needed</i> him. To
have felt now that he loved her, in spite of what he had
heard, he could and would protect her. He stood before
her now and she saw him as she had never seen him
before. How strong and brave and courageous he was!
He was her hero. She went to sleep after a time, a
troubled, fitful sleep, and when she heard Constance
calling her the following morning, she awoke with a start
and was rested, although she could not understand how
it was possible. But she was calm. After all, she felt,
maybe, her fear was premature.</p>

<p>She worked that day with her usual good spirits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_NINE_2" id="CHAPTER_NINE_2"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>But Smith Is Not His Real Name</i>"</p>


<p>Owen Beasely. That was his name, and Sidney met
him while waiting for a subscriber, who failed to show up.
He was a relative of Smith's, whom he had met the day
before. It was two P.M., the fourth day of July, and
the colored people, as well as the white, had retired to
a day of delight. It was hot, and clouds rolled up, white-capped
from the west. "It would rain before night,"
the weather man said, and it did.</p>

<p>"And so you came from the west," said Beasely, who
had been reading <i>The Tempest</i>. Wyeth had seen him
working behind the counter, and they put aside all
formality of introduction. Wyeth was glad to meet
someone to talk to that day. He had come out to this
suburb, under promise of subscribers to take the book.
And, since every one of them had retracted, he was discouraged,
which is a disagreeable feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied gloomily, "and the day I return will
be one of great happiness. I am not particularly in love
with being down here anyhow; and the sooner I see the
plains again, that much sooner will I be happy and
contented."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled the other lazily, "having been born
down here, and never having seen the rest of this great
domain, I do not, of course, know the difference; still,
I have always cherished a longing to go west. I intended
going to Oklahoma years ago, and getting in on some of
that government land they were giving away, but I put
it off until it was too late, and then too, I had trouble in
my family. My oldest daughter married a worthless
rascal who burdened her with those children you see
playing about the store, and I had to take care of them
and her too, since her marriage left her in bad health."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The other listened without comment. Beasely, however,
went on, apparently in a mood to relate the past.</p>

<p>"Smith has been telling me about you, and I have
been anxious to have a talk with you. Smith is my
brother-in-law, and he too, has had his share of trials."</p>

<p>By this time, they had settled themselves on the porch
of an empty quarter house. Wyeth chanced to look
around, and, seeing so many empty ones, said: "How
does this come to be? So many empty houses?"</p>

<p>"Bulgarians lived in this row," he said, pointing to
them. "Hundreds of them, and when the war broke out
in the Balkan states, every last one of them left here and
went back to fight, and have not returned."</p>

<p>"Some patriotism, eh!" Wyeth commented.</p>

<p>"It is singular about these foreigners," he said thoughtfully.
"Have you ever observed them?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. Beasely went on.</p>

<p>"They come to this country without knowing a word
of our language, and from a poor country. But they are
not here ten years, before they are able, financially, to
buy a car load of our people. Negroes are certainly a
problem to themselves. These foreigners always have
money, and many of them return to the old country and
retire, after a few years of just ordinary hard work here;
while many of our people at the same job, if they get sick
a week, are on the county.</p>

<p>"Clerking in a store where the trade is of the kind we
have," he went on, "is an opportunity for the best study
in human nature you can possibly imagine. A man like
Smith, for instance, can succeed with the trade of his
people, when he can get it. Smith has succeeded on the
heels of his own failure."</p>

<p>"It appears harder for one of us to succeed, than for
any other race now, doesn't it?" commented Wyeth.</p>

<p>"It does, it does indeed," said Beasely. "Somehow the
money gets through our fingers, despite our efforts to
hold it."</p>

<p>"This morning," said Sidney, "I had an experience
that amused me. I had the promise to take a book to a
certain fellow in Averytown. I called accordingly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the same, but he had just left. His family didn't, rather
couldn't tell me where I was likely to find him. I came
on up the street that leads here, and made inquiries on
the way. Every one who knew him gave me the same
advice. 'If,' they said, 'he is not home, just go to every
saloon between here and there, and you will be sure to
find him.' I did so, and found him at the second one."</p>

<p>"And did he take it?" asked Beasely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hadn't thought of it since. No, he didn't take
the book&mdash;but I think he will. He had no money, and
when I approached him he went to the commissary, took
a scrip and got some groceries. These he took to somebody
and sold them, a dollar and a half worth for a
dollar. He then gave me a quarter, and told me to
bring it next pay day." After a moment he said: "Smith
is an exceptional business man for a Negro, and an interesting
man to talk to."</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled the other; "but Smith is not his real
name. He took that after coming here. And since we
have spoken of it, I'm going to tell you the story of John
Smith, alias Thomas Rollins." He laughed as his voice,
very dramatic in what he had just said, came back to
him.</p>

<p>The other listened, and prepared himself to do so comfortably,
while Beasely mopped his forehead, drew his
breath, and prepared to tell the following story.</p>

<p>Beasely was a black man&mdash;a full blood&mdash;and intelligent.
Nearly fifty years he seemed to be, although, at a passing
glance, he would have passed for forty. He had been a
school teacher, and had some education, Wyeth had observed
from his careful use of English.</p>

<p>"We lived in Palmetto, Georgia, where he married my
sister. He was then a farmer and pastor of the Baptist
church, while I farmed and taught the local country
school. He had been in politics quite actively in the
eighties and early nineties, as were many other Negroes
during the reconstruction period, and had served as postmaster
for four years. Now, in this town were what is
called a bunch of pet Negroes. These were coons whom
the white people used as local goats for their amusements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
And, so to speak, they were a sort of privileged character,
but became too familiar. As everywhere in the south,
this town had its herd of the poor trash, that kept things
stirred up in the way of lynching and other lawlessness.
Considerable incendiarism had occurred of late, and some
of these pets were accused. Friction had been evident
for some time in this county and all around, and, with
this burning and accusations, a wholesale lynching took
place. About a dozen of these pets were herded into a
box car, and burned alive. It was the most diabolical
thing that could be perpetrated by human beings, and
created much comment all over the country. It drove
hundreds of Negroes out of the county, and you will find
them scattered over the rest of the state and other parts
now. Sometime after this, a strange Negro came to
town, and hung around Smith's place for a while. He
secured a job finally with a white man, who was one of
the men who led the mob. It seems, one day, he overheard
him relating how they burned the pets. This
crazed the Negro, or it might have been that one of the
victims was a brother of his, who knows. Well, this
Negro took an ax, marched into the room, and without
a word, split open the man's head.</p>

<p>"He made his escape. Pandemonium reigned. Lynching
by hanging and burning at the stake became common,
and a general state of lawlessness reigned for some time.</p>

<p>"Now, after this Negro had killed the man, he came
by Smith's and got the clothes Smith's cook had washed
for him. He threatened her with death if she ever said
anything about it. Well, a lot of the poor crackers had
become jealous of Smith anyhow, and they tried to implicate
him in it, while he knew nothing about it. Smith
stood well with the best white people; but when any
friction comes up in these parts, the cracker is supreme,
because he has the numbers. So, while the mob spirit
was still prevalent, they decided to give vent to their
jealousy, and called on Smith with a dark purpose. They
charged him with having furnished this Negro with an
ax and instructions to kill the cracker. So they were
on the way to see him, when I warned him at church one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Sunday morning, preparing to preach a sermon. He
hurried home, grabbed a few things, and left the state as
fast as he could leave it.</p>

<p>"That is how Smith came to be in this country and
doing business; but there is another part of this chapter,
and which brings us up to the present.</p>

<p>"A Negro worked for Smith back there, and after the
thing had died out and people there saw that he was
wrongly accused, this Negro came on here, and since
then, this has been his home. Having known him back
there, Smith trusted him in the store here, and continued
to trust him until he was head over heels in debt to him.
There came a day when Smith was tired of this, and
called him to account. The Negro, then, instead of paying
like a man, or making an effort to do so, howled his
head off and was surprised, or professed to be. He told
Smith that he was repaid from the fact that he had kept
his mouth closed about his past, his changing his name,
and all that. In conclusion, he threatened to tell the
world, or that part of it in which Smith and himself were
known. Now, if Smith had told all this in the beginning,
it would, of course, have been different. But, having
deferred it so long, he naturally hated to have it told
and flaunted in his face by the Negroes here. You know,
too, how Negroes like to hear anything, envious and
spiteful as they are by nature. It was a nasty affair, and
to hush it up, Smith let the bill go hang. But this was
not to be the end of it by any means, oh, no! This
Negro had the nerve to come back into the store and ask
for more credit. Then Smith, with his nigga aroused,
stood his ground. The Negro then got drunk, fighting
drunk. He found an old revolver that had been lost for
years in a trash heap, and ran Smith all over town. It
wouldn't shoot, of course, but Smith didn't know that.
The crowd finally got around the Negro and held him,
while he raged and swore. Smith went to the phone,
declaring he was going to call the officers. The Negro
yelled that if he did&mdash;he knew. Smith desisted, but then
into it came my sister, his wife. She has spirit and was
now thoroughly aroused and with a big forty-five <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>left-hand
wheeler, she sought this shine. When the people
that were holding him saw her coming, they turned him
lose and flew. When they did, she began to shoot, and
shot to hit. She missed; but she picked the dirt all
about him, and he did some running.</p>

<p>"After that, the Negro&mdash;he had been doing fairly well
outside what I have mentioned&mdash;began to go down.
Whiskey and craps got all his money, and then he parted
with his wife. But he still had it in for Smith, and it had
come to Smith and me, too, that he intends telling it all
at the ball game, today. Moreover, that he will kill his
wife if she plays ball or attempts to, today. Smith's
nigga is up, and he is going to the ball game, and if that
Negro starts anything on that diamond, look out!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of these Negroes down here myself," said
Wyeth. "A few nights ago, I was standing on a corner
in Effingham, when one of them came up the street
slapping his wife or woman, or whatever she was, something
outrageously. I felt constrained to punch him in
the jaw, the brute, especially when she ran around a
bunch of us trying to escape the blows he was raining on
her face. I didn't, and some time later I was talking
with a cop that patrols that beat. I told him of the
incident. 'That's nothing,' he said. 'I started to punch
him,' I said. 'You'd better not punch any of these
Negroes,' he warned. 'They'll shoot you down like a
dog. This is Effingham.'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Beasely, "I'm going to the game myself
to have a hand in the affair, if he starts anything.
Wanta go 'long?"</p>

<p>Since he had nothing to do, he decided that it would
be a good outing and some diversion, so, rising, he followed.
As they started, a ragged, dirty Negro rushed
up. He wanted Beasely, being unable to locate Smith,
to let him have ten dollars to get his brother out of jail,
who had gotten into a squabble down in a saloon and got
run in.</p>

<p>"Let him stay there until tomorrow, and we won't
have to get him out but once. If he is gotten out today,
he's liable to be in again before the day is spent," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Beasely carelessly. The other went his way with mutterings.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they came upon another.
He had a load, a heavy load. So heavy that he could
scarcely make it. However, with a superior effort, he
managed to drag his feet along, and join them.</p>

<p>"Abe Thomas," remonstrated Beasely. "You are a
disgrace to yourself and the human race." The other
accepted the rebuke in good nature. He declared, that
since it was the fourth, he was entitled by the law of the
land to get drunk, and convince the public to that effect.</p>

<p>"The fourth do'n' come but once a yeah," he said.
"But I'm a good guy all the time 'n' all the time. Fifty
years I've been in this world and don't look forty." He
didn't, which was an odd thing, thought Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Say, Beasely, lend me a dollar!" he exclaimed.
Wyeth was again surprised; for Beasely, without a word,
but a laugh full of humor, drew forth a silver dollar, and
handed it over.</p>

<p>As they walked along leisurely, Wyeth remarked
about the crops, which did not appear to be doing much
good in the highlands.</p>

<p>"You know why that is?" said their companion, winking
wisely. "That's because all this land about here is
undermined, and the water goes on through."</p>

<p>Wyeth looked at him. He looked back at Wyeth and
winked. "You are philosophical indeed," said he. "How
far is it to the mines below?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred feet," Beasely replied.</p>

<p>"And between that is all kinds of rock, hard pan and
shale?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," replied the other; "but what has that to
do with it?"</p>

<p>Wyeth looked at him, but the other didn't gather what
the expression meant, so he said: "Jok, you are full."
They were passing into a cut, and he saw at a glance the
reason for the plant suffering. About two to six inches
from the surface was a thick layer of jip, which, as he
knew, prevented the water from going into the subsoil,
to come up when the sun had dried the surface, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
furnish nourishment to the roots. Further argument was
not necessary, for, as they came out of the cut, a saloon
smiled before them, and into this their companion disappeared.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the grounds, thousands had
preceded them, and the same was black with people,
enjoying a holiday. The diamond had been cleared, and
preparations were in order for opening of the game.
The contestants were a set of school boys and girls, and
women, in fact, any girl or woman that could be prevailed
upon for the occasion. The sun, now in the west, could
be seen only at intervals, as it hung suspended above
the heavy treetops. The air was unusually still and
humid. The heat was intense; but, notwithstanding the
fact, the future American Negro seemed to be getting all
that a holiday afforded.</p>

<p>Popcorn and cracker-jack, lemonade and coca-cola,
barbecue and fried fish, were being consumed by the
crowd in every direction in large quantities, and all
seemed to be happy.</p>

<p>At last the preliminaries were over. The game was
called. On every base, in the pitcher's box, the catchers,
and in the field, stood black girls. Gayly they flitted
about, and caught the ball cleverly, as it was thrown
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Play ball!" called the umpire.</p>

<p>Everyone had his eye upon the game. A strapping
woman, wound up like a professional, and let drive a
swift ball that went far to the right of a left hand batter.</p>

<p>"Ba-l-l one!" cried the umpire.</p>

<p>"Frow lak a ole maid," cackled a big-mouthed Negro,
who was immediately hooted down.</p>

<p>"St-r-i-k-e one!" cried the umpire, slapping his thigh,
giving vent to a big laugh, as the batter swung wildly
at the ball just missed.</p>

<p>"Dat gal's got some speed, b'lieve muh!" cried another
Negro, who was a good support.</p>

<p>"Who dat gal?" inquired another, at this point.</p>

<p>"Do'n you know 'er?" someone else replied. "Dat's
Bobb Lee's wife. Dey is pa'ted, y' know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyeth started. Bobb Lee's wife! Bobb Lee was the
Negro Beasely had told him about.... And he had
threatened to kill her if she played ball this day. She
was playing. He felt a strange pulling at his nerves as
he watched her, and his imagination began to play. He
was afraid of these Negroes. Even if they did nothing,
they could, so far as he had learned, be depended upon
to commit murder. No one, perhaps, paid much attention
to a Negro's threat; but he didn't feel just right in
the stomach. A chilly feeling was creeping upward and
held him. He looked about him. For a moment he had
forgotten the game. The men were now on the bases,
while the girls were swinging in many ways at the ball.
The wife of Bobb Lee was there at the bat. Around him
the crowd watched her closely, expectantly. He did likewise.</p>

<p>"B-a-l-l one!" cried the umpire. The woman was a
stout Negress, with square, broad hips, and was conspicuous
in the green uniform. Two balls and one strike
were against her, when the fourth came whizzing across
the plate. She struck it with terrific force, that sent it
just over the heads of all and beyond the fielders, making
a clean home run, as well as bringing in two girls that
were on bases. The cheering that followed was deafening.
For a time Sidney forgot the threats of the bad Negro.</p>

<p>Again the wife of Bobb Lee was pitching. More speed
had developed since last she held the ball, and she was
apparently more clever. She hurled the ball across the
plate so swiftly, that the crowd could hardly see it, nor
could the batters, whom, one by one she fanned. Two
balls and two strikes she had on the last one. Wyeth's
gaze, wandering across the diamond, observed John
Smith standing to the other side, and again the words
of Beasely came to his memory. He wished the thought
and the threat would not so persist. He tried to concentrate
his mind on the game, but the words lingered.
During his whole life, Sidney now recalled, he was
peculiarly given to predestination. If he had not seen
anyone he had known for some time, and happened to
meet him, he could always recall that he had just thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of him a few days before, or it might have been only a
few hours before. Strangely, as he watched the game,
there came to him a premonition that something was
going to happen. He felt it so strongly that he stood
waiting for it. It was only a question of a little while.</p>

<p>The wife of Bobb Lee had raised her arm and was
winding up for the last throw, when suddenly, from
across the field in the crowd, came a cry as of some one
mad, enraged. In the still, humid air, the cry of a woman
resounded, and fell upon the ears of the crowd like a cry
of death. There was a shot, and so quiet did every one
appear at the moment, that the noise it made sounded
like a cannon. A woman rushed upon the diamond, and
fell prone on her face, with a last scream that disturbed
the quiet.</p>

<p>Clouds had been gathering overhead for some time,
and now they overcast the skies. The sunlight, with all
its brightness of a few minutes ago, had faded; it became
so dark that the people could scarcely see across the
diamond. Heavy peals of thunder added now to the
darkness, while flashes of lightning struck electrically all
about. The crowd stood awestruck. The woman in the
box had lowered her arm, and was looking wild-eyed at
the woman who had fallen prostrate at her feet. And
then, through the still air came again the cry of the
beast.</p>

<p>"Ah tole yu' 'f yu' played ball ag'in ah'd kill yu'.
Ah've killed yu' doity sista, in the' stands you, 'n' the'
is John Smith who run away frum Palmetto, Geo'gi', 'n'
whose real name's Tom Rollins!" And with that, the
woman gave a long lingering cry that frightened all those
about. They turned in one great mass, the revolver
sounded another shot, and with scarcely a groan, the
woman staggered for a moment, and fell to the ground
dead. For just a second it seemed, the crowd, tearing
wildly about, halted and turned their eyes upon the two
dead women. And as they did so, the murderer turned
wildly in the direction of where Smith had stood, but he
was gone. In a blind fury, the drunken brute whirled
around dazed, yelling: "Wha' is he! Damn him! Wha'
is he!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm heah, you beast!" roared Smith, in a terrible
voice. The other had just time to see him, but too late
to do further murder. John Smith was on him in an
instant, and all the strength of his powerful frame
seemed to come to him in that moment. He snatched
the smoking weapon from the hand of the brute, and,
raising it to the length of his large arm, while the other,
at last sensitive to the moment, saw it as it lingered one
brief instant, with eyes, the sight of which Sidney Wyeth
did not soon forget, it fell, crushing the skull. A mad
herd now, the crowd rushed upon the fallen creature
and did the rest.</p>

<p>Just then the heavens opened up with a mighty crash
of thunder, and there came a flash of lightning that made
trees tremble, while the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Sidney returned to the city by the first car. The
incident rose before him again and again, as the car
crept along in the downpour. He had seen the first
murder of his life, which, however, was an almost daily
occurrence in Effingham. When he reached his room
and related the incident, it caused less excitement than
when he once witnessed a gambling raid and related it.
No one took murder seriously in Effingham.</p>

<p>"They kill a nigga every day on an average in this
town," grinned Moore. When he read the papers the
following morning, he had about given up finding it at
all, when his eyes came across a small paragraph in the
corner, reporting that a drunken Negro had killed his
wife and sister-in-law, which added to the list of casualties,
making eleven for the day in Effingham. All were
homicides. No deaths from other sources were reported.</p>

<p>As Sidney Wyeth now saw it, the people might have
prosperity, and they might have happiness; likewise,
they might suffer reverses and be in hard straights for a
time; but of one thing there seemed a certainty, that as
long as whiskey was available, crime would be prevalent
in Effingham.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth had never voted for prohibition. As he
saw it now in Attalia, where it was not sold legally, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in Effingham, where it had this permit, there seemed but
one conclusion. Only when they stopped making it,
would these ignorant, semi-barbarous creatures quit
drinking it.</p>

<p>And thus we find conditions in one of our great American
cities, where there is forty per cent of illiteracy
among two-fifths of the populace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Having sent for a considerable consignment of books,
and, due to the inability to collect from a number who
spent their money on the fourth, Sidney found his finances
depleted. Room rent, by paying in advance was due the
following Monday, so, taking himself to one of his subscribers
among the servants, he was able to collect only
a dollar that day. Half of this he divided with his landlady,
promising to pay her the remainder on the morrow.
He did so, but John Moore desired to question in regard
to the same. The truth of it was that John Moore
wanted the dollar, and had figured on it, in order to
shoot craps on Saturday night, as was his usual custom.
So John came into the room where Sidney sat reading.
It happened that Wyeth was in no pleasant frame of
mind, and, calling was thus not in order that evening.
Perhaps John Moore did not know this, but he did a
few minutes later. He wished to know what Wyeth was
going to do about the rent.</p>

<p>Wyeth looked at him. It wasn't a very pleasant look,
to say the least. And Wyeth was one of these creatures
who could not stand to be dunned. Since he had already
made arrangement with the real person, he regarded
Moore out of eyes now that narrowed with anger. He
said something, sharp and quick, and stinging. Thereupon,
a storm ensued.</p>

<p>"I aised you a civil question," complained Moore.</p>

<p>"And I tell you that I have already arranged with the
landlady regarding the rent, and don't want any argument
with you!"</p>

<p>"Then I ais you to git yo' things and get out!" cried
Moore, with an air of finality.</p>

<p>"And I tell you that I will do no such thing; more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>over,
you, insofar as I'm concerned," cried Wyeth heatedly,
"can go to Hell!"</p>

<p>"Look out, look out!" cried Moore. "I'm a-comin',
I'm a-comin'."</p>

<p>"Not very fast as I can see, standing there in the doorway,"
said Wyeth, now composed, and reseating himself
from where he had risen. And yet he felt, as he had
never felt before, like fighting&mdash;with his fists.</p>

<p>"Hole me Mary, hole me!" cried Moore, moving
many ways&mdash;in the doorway. The other waited&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p>"Come ova' he' from Attalia, a bad nigga, 'n' tellin'
me what I ain' go'n do 'n' mah house!" he cried, now
derisively. "Stay! Yes, stay, 'n' be killed, 'cause 'f you
sleep in this house t'night, you go'n sleep ova' mah dead
body."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you're an awful liar," smiled Sidney grimly.
He arose from his chair and moved in the direction of
Moore, whereupon that worthy moved in the opposite
direction. "A Negro like you ain't going to fight anyone,
and talk about your dead body! Hump! If you
had any idea I was going to kill you, you'd be a mile
away by this time and still running. As it is, I am
going to stay in this house until I get ready to leave, or
at least until I am ordered out by the landlady." With
this, he jumped forward quickly and caught Moore by
the nose, which was, to say the least, a difficult task.
He pinched it hard, and then, with well directed licks,
he slapped his face with his open palm. Then, giving
his nose another pinch that made the creature scream
with pain, he pushed him with such force that he fell
backward into the other room. A moment later, Sidney
slammed the door, and, resuming his seat, picked up
the book and began reading.</p>

<p>They were good friends ever after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>When You Have Been Grass-Widowed, It's Different</i>"</p>


<p>"Oh, is it Mr. Wyeth? How-do, Mr. Wyeth. Come
right in and be seated. I shall be in presently." Whereupon,
for the fraction of a second, Miss Palmer gave him
a smile that was bewitching.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and a beautiful cool day in July. A
rain had fallen the night before, which made the air cool
and radiant. Just a day for an outing. To go forth
into the forest on a day like this, in company with the
lady of his choice, was a pleasure all men could wish.
And to go forth today, to the forest about Effingham,
which could be seen from almost any part of the city,
was, to say the least, a treat. From the summit of any
of the many points, the observer could gaze down full
upon all that makes Effingham.</p>

<p>And it was for such a purpose that Sidney Wyeth
called upon Miss Annie Palmer that day.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer had been good to him. And he, a man of
experience and adversities, was not the kind of man to
be indifferent to her courtesy. And, besides, Miss Palmer
was fairly well endowed with the art of making it pleasant.
Especially was this so when it happened to be a
young man who had captivated her, and, apparently,
without any effort on his part.</p>

<p>It is said that curiosity is the inspiration of invention,
and that women, although with no great record as inventors,
cannot stand to be held in doubt. Sidney
Wyeth had aroused Miss Palmer. It was whispered that
other men had done so before, but no one spoke ill of
Miss Palmer. It was so told here and there that she
desired to marry. Miss Palmer found it difficult to keep
Sidney out of her thoughts; daily, hourly and, sometimes
she sighed, it seemed minutely. So, when he had sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>gested
an outing, she had accepted with all the grace of
which she was capable. It had been arranged for this
day. She had worked hard every day preceding it, and
had sold a number of books. As we now know, Miss
Palmer was the mother of a very young son, and she
had always had to work to care for him, herself, and her
mother, who was somewhat of an invalid. Perhaps this
was the best excuse Miss Palmer had for not having remarried.
It was a plausible one, no one could deny. It
sufficed to arouse sympathy for her, and she had many
friends who unhesitatingly spoke of her in such terms.</p>

<p>"Miss Palmer has a hard time," said one.</p>

<p>"What kind of a deal&mdash;that is, what kind of a husband
was the man she married?"</p>

<p>"A half white nigga from Ohio, whose parents made
him mistreat her, because she was not brighter in color.
They never forgave him for marrying anything but a
'high yellow.' So they, through their treatment of her,
snubbing her whenever they could, simply broke them
up. She was a good girl," so everybody said about Miss
Palmer, "and she worked night and day to help him,
but he drank. His parents kept up the game of spoiling
him, even after he was the father of her child. So, in
the end, when there was nothing else for her to do, she
had asked for, and was duly granted a divorce. That
ended it. The school board, although they were overrun
with applications from multitudes of colored girls,
to teach in the city schools (because teaching is about
the only thing they can get to do to make some money
and a living for themselves), had reinstated her, and she
went back to teaching, after four years of unhappy
married life."</p>

<p>It was thus Sidney Wyeth had found her. Miss Palmer
was a human being with a heart that cried silently for
the love of a man, as all other women's hearts do, who
happen not to be so fortunate as to have one. She had
been to school, and graduated from a normal academy,
that taught English as far as it goes, and, likewise, compelled
the girls to learn how to cook, sew and save. Miss
Palmer was mistress in all these arts, and some more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
It was her delight to show them by a demonstration,
whenever she could. She had proven all this to Sidney
Wyeth, and he had thought it practical in her. He had
said as much, but he would have said as much to any
other, no doubt. And of the many good things we now
know of Miss Palmer, let us not forget that she was
selfish to a degree.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many of us are. But when Miss Palmer
became the recipient of such kind words from the lips
of this man of mystery, for as such she regarded him,
and believed it, she was subtly delighted. So she had
done all she could as a saleswoman of the book she was
positive he had written, to prove further her ability to
help him. (?) Today they would be all alone, together.
She had looked forward to the same with all the anxiety
of the anxious, and the day had come at last. And such
a day!</p>

<p>She dressed in her best for the occasion. We shall not
attempt to describe her; but when she appeared at the
end of an hour, she was a delight to observe. "Indeed!"
exclaimed Wyeth frankly, "I didn't know you could
look so well!"</p>

<p>"Why are you flat?" she complained, with a frown;
and then she added softly: "You could be otherwise."</p>

<p>"We will catch the Tidewater and get off at Jewell
Junction, and take the Relay. That will take us to the
summit of Baldin Knob. From there you can see everything
this state possesses for fifteen miles," she said, as
they walked cheerfully in the direction of the car line.</p>

<p>Never had either experienced such a delightful ride, as
the heavy tidewater cars gave them that morning. The
Relay unloaded them forty minutes later at the highest
peak of which the Red Mountains boast. Below lay
Effingham, the iron city, a medley of smoke and many
little points. Only the blast of the furnaces, and the
heavy smoke they belched forth, met their gaze, as they
saw it now. It seemed hardly possible that it was a
city of so many thousands, it seemed so small at this
distance. A mass of uneven timber appeared all about
and below them, and far away were a thousand peaks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Broken by hundreds of ravines and draws, that split and
tore the mighty range, they saw the city beyond. A
dull haze as of Indian summer hung in the distance, as
their gaze sought the horizon.</p>

<p>Then they walked down a slope to a spot they had
seen. She stepped on a rock that lay buried beneath
many leaves, and turned her ankle so severely, that he
feared it had been sprained. It hadn't; but, as a precaution,
he took her arm, and that, perforce, brought
them closer together. Thus they walked, until, at the
foot of a pine, lay a fallen tree conveniently. They sat
themselves thereon, and, leaning their backs against the
tree, for a minute, possibly more, they heard their own
breathing.</p>

<p>After saying many things that meant nothing, she said:</p>

<p>"Now, you are going to tell me all about yourself
today, aren't you?" She ended this beautifully, and
waited likewise. His reply was not gallant, if such it
could be; but he merely added:</p>

<p>"There is little to tell, Miss Palmer&mdash;so little, I'm
sure telling it would be dull for you to listen to."</p>

<p>"You have beautiful ways of saying anything," she
said, and gave him her best smile. He looked at her
now, but without any apparent enthusiasm. His smile
was a little tired and weary and sad. Very often he was
this way.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Miss Palmer now said, "you have
impressed me wonderfully."</p>

<p>"I didn't, I'm sure; but you are complimentary."
He was now a mite more cheerful. "In what way, I beg,
have I impressed you? In that I can sell books?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that, and you know I do not," she
pouted. "And you can be so innocent, when you want
to be. Oh, you are artful. But I mean, if I must say it
and then explain why, there is something about you
that is unusual. You are in disguise, going through the
country studying people, yes, people and what they are,
have been and are likely to be." She was thoughtful
now, as she sat in serious mood for some time. Presently,
she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've been reading that book, and, of course, I understand
you better. Is all that you say in it true?"
She was serious now, and anxious too. She waited eagerly
for him to speak.</p>

<p>He laughed. Then he said nothing in the affirmative,
but indulged in words concerning other topics.</p>

<p>"You are more than a book agent. You have, at
least, been a man of means. Really, I would be pleased
to know from your own lips," she now sighed.</p>

<p>"I wish we could talk of something else, that would
be more interesting. Cannot you suggest something?"
he turned to her now appealingly.</p>

<p>"I cannot. Yourself is the most interesting thing I
care to talk about. I have been thinking of the terrible
secret you disclose in the book. Won't you please tell
me if it is all true?"</p>

<p>"I suppose if <i>the</i> book is published as a true story,
then it must be so," he said evasively.</p>

<p>"And she was a weak woman. No strength and conviction;
nothing to protect a home. You and she will
not remain as you are, will you?" Silence. "There is
nothing the matter with you&mdash;and her. I sympathize
with <i>this fellow</i>." Miss Palmer was more serious now.
"Because, apparently, he wanted, tried to do the right
thing, and was not allowed.... I know somebody else
that wished to do likewise, and was not allowed....
Life is a strange thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed so," he agreed.</p>

<p>"And on this pilgrimage you study the lives of others,
many others, and it reveals so much to you that would,
could not be possible, otherwise?"</p>

<p>He agreed with her again.</p>

<p>"And on this pilgrimage you have met <i>women</i>, and you
have studied them and their way of seeing things?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. They are all in the same category."</p>

<p>"Yes; but somebody said: 'I bet that fellow has <i>so</i>
many girls!' I didn't agree with them. I don't think
you have any; you are too preoccupied to give them
serious thought. Perhaps that is why the girl allowed
herself to be taken away...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>He now looked at her. His lips, for one moment, had
started to speak, and then he seemed to think better of
it, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Everyone I sell the book to cries when they have
read it: 'If I had been that fellow, I'd have kicked that
old preacher into Hades.' It's what you tell in the last
part of the book that arouses the people. But they all
think <i>he</i> acted with poor judgment in the end; but if <i>he</i>
hadn't allowed that to come to pass, I would never have
known you." Miss Palmer was tantalizing.</p>

<p>"Out in this <i>Rosebud Country</i>, of which the story is
told, are there no colored people?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be dreadfully lonesome."</p>

<p>"Why so? The white people are kind and sociable."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I would prefer my kind. Still, I suppose
if one lived there and had their all there, it would be
different."</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it would be different."</p>

<p>"You will, no doubt, marry one of the many girls
you meet before you return, and then live happily ever
afterwards."</p>

<p>"That is nice to listen to. Nice girls, that is, girls who
are willing to sacrifice to an end that would help both,
are, to say the least, hard to find."</p>

<p>"Yes, in a sense; but there are plenty. And all want
husbands. Of course, when you have been widowed,
grass-widowed, it's different...."</p>

<p>"Well, yes; but I see no reason, if she is the right
kind of girl, why she cannot re-marry and be happy in
the end."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't," she essayed. "Well, there is. A
woman is never regarded as the same. The looks she
gets are not like the ones bestowed upon her when she,
or before she married. They are looks&mdash;looks that are
not honest," she sighed. He was silent.</p>

<p>"And the men are the cause of it. All of it. Sometimes
I hate men."</p>

<p>He saw her now, calmly. She was uneasy under the
look he gave her. And then he was silent again. She
went on:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, there are some that are different. Yourself,
for instance."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"So many I hardly like to say. So unassuming, for
one. And then you&mdash;oh I won't say it."</p>

<p>"Please do."</p>

<p>"Not until you have told me more about yourself.
Has it occurred to you that you have told me nothing,
absolutely nothing about yourself?" She was looking at
him now. He winced.</p>

<p>"Of course, if a woman is&mdash;is&mdash;well, easy enough to
go into the mountains and on an outing with the man&mdash;a
man who has told her nothing of himself, then, it&mdash;he
cannot be censured." She watched a pine squirrel now
that played near, and who regarded them out of eyes
that made Miss Palmer feel guilty.</p>

<p>"You are like a stone wall when it comes to secrets.
Did you ever really love anyone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't mean it!" she cried in feigned surprise.
"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"You would be no wiser if I told you."</p>

<p>At this moment, a blast in a mine near, which they
did not see, went off. It broke the silence so sharply,
that both sat quickly upright. In doing so, their hands
met. His clasped hers. In a moment the tension was
released, but the hands were not. Slowly their hands
clasped each others tighter. He was in some way conscious
of the fact, while she was dreamy. He looked by
chance into her eyes, and they were more dreamy still.
Their shoulders touched. She sat at his left, and it
happened singularly to be his right hand that held hers.
In that moment they seemed to feel lonely, very lonely.
Both had suffered&mdash;and, to a degree, their suffering had
been similar. To give up and to be human, unconventionally
so for just a little while, seemed a mad desire.
She swayed perceptibly. Suddenly his left arm stole
about her waist and encircled her body. Mechanically
he looked down, and into her eyes, that were upturned.
They seemed to tell the secret behind. To be loved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
one minute was what they asked. He lingered a moment,
and then his head went down. When it had retained its
former position and was erect, he had kissed Miss Palmer.</p>

<p>He was standing now, and was looking down upon
Effingham. It lay silent and gray from where he saw it.
In that moment he wanted to be back there. He felt
guilty. He turned and beheld Miss Palmer. He felt
more guilty than before. She lay against the tree with
her face turned the other way. He felt very sorry for
her then. Yes, Miss Palmer would, he believed, do the
right thing. <i>She would be glad</i> to do the right thing.
Oh, she had had her troubles. And Sidney Wyeth knew
that when people had suffered, especially when it had
been their great ambition to do the right thing and be
happy, they would go through eternity to make happiness
possible. He spoke now.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better be going, Miss
Palmer?" She heard him, and his voice was kind, she
thought. She rose, and together they went back over
the hill and caught the Relay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>I'm Worried About Mildred</i>"</p>


<p>"Wilson, I'm worried. I'm worried about Mildred.
Something is haunting that girl. Something has been
haunting her for days. She says nothing, of course; but
I can see, I can't help but see. She is worried almost to
insanity." So Constance said to her brother, some days
after Mildred met the man who saw her in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it can be," said he, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'd give anything to know," she sighed. "The
only thing I know is that she is worried. I dare not ask
her. She is not inviting in her demeanor, when it comes
to confidences. She seems to be looking for something,
simply uneasy always, and hesitant. Some days, she
seems to dislike to go canvassing; in fact, for some time
now, she has been nervous every time she ventures out."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether it would not be advisable to ask
her to lay off a few days."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," said she; "but she has so
many deliveries to make that she is almost compelled to
go out every day. And then, if what she fears is to
happen, I'm sure she would be more worried if she
stayed in."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to do anything to help Mildred." She
looked at him, but they were both too preoccupied to
take notice of the fact that he had called her by her
first name.</p>

<p>"The only time I can seem to get her away from
that worried, tired expression, is when I play. She
listens and becomes, at least for a time, oblivious to her
troubles."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>By day, Mildred, when she was canvassing, hourly
expected to meet again the man whose recognition had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
frightened her. But the days went by without further
encounter, and when she failed to meet him, she began
to relax. She was worried constantly, but she was
relieved after two weeks. The fright had passed, and she
was cheerful again, much to the relief of her two friends.
It had pained her to see that both were obviously worried
on her account. And she respected them, because they
were considerate enough not to ask her questions that
would have annoyed her.</p>

<p>"You sang that beautifully, Miss Latham," said
Wilson, one afternoon, when she left the piano, after
singing a song that had been introduced lately into
church services; and which, while sentimental, nevertheless
possessed more thrill than the average.</p>

<p>"Do you think I can satisfy the congregation now?"
she asked sweetly. She had been practicing it for several
afternoons.</p>

<p>"I should say you could," he cried, enthusiastically.
"You could satisfy any congregation, much less our
little crowd." He looked sorrowful, as he said this. She
understood. The great majority did not attend his
services. They went to the big Baptist church two
blocks away. Many of them even smiled, when they
passed his little church and observed the few people
sitting therein. Mildred sympathised with him, because
she realized that he was a courageous young man, willing
to go to any extent, so far as effort was concerned, in
order to help those about him. They needed it too,
these black people.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, so kind that he choked, "you will
have a larger church some day. I am confident you
will&mdash;I <i>know you will</i>." And she meant all she said. "In
time the people will come to appreciate your efforts.
As it is now, they don't think deep enough to do so.
They want sermons, as yet, that make them feel by
merely listening; whereas, it is necessary to study what
you say.... That makes it difficult now. When the
people become more intelligent, more practical, and more
thoughtful, they will appreciate religion in a practical
sense." He was overwhelmed with gratitude, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
heard these words. For a moment he couldn't speak.
He felt the tears come.</p>

<p>"You are so kind, Miss Latham. You seem to understand,
and see below the surface. And what you have
said is timely. I am one, you may be sure, who appreciates
it." He stopped here.</p>

<p>A choking, which he didn't wish her to notice, made it
necessary. She was aware of the gratitude, the sincere
gratitude in his tone, and her sympathy went out to him
more than ever. As she saw him sitting there, with head
bowed and face hid, he seemed his mother's boy. She
felt strangely that other part. Impulsively, she advanced
to where he sat by the window, with the sunlight streaming
in upon him. In the bright, soft light, his curly hair
shone, and seemed more beautiful than she had noticed
it before. She laid her hand upon it. An hour ago, she
would not, could not have dreamed she would do this.
And then she spoke in words, the kindest, he felt, he had
ever heard.</p>

<p>"There, now. It will be all right. Just give yourself
time. Oh, it's a great struggle, this human problem.
All these black ones of ours. But you are pursuing the
right course, and some day they will see it. Then will
come your success. It's going to come. It will come.
It <i>must</i> come. These people can't keep on going along
as they are; this crime&mdash;murder. It's terrible. Someone
will help to stem the tide of it, someone will lead
them. They need leaders. They are not bad people,
with all we see and now know of them. They simply
need some one to lead them into the light. I feel you
will be that person. Yes. I am sure you are the person."
She paused a moment, and it was only then, she
became aware that her hand still rested upon his head.
She removed it now, and silently left the room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I love her! I love her!" cried Wilson Jacobs. "Oh,
God lead me, for I know not whither I go!"</p>

<p>It was the first time in his thirty-one years that Wilson
Jacobs had felt so. But he was a man. And the fact
made him respect Mildred Latham the more. Not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
anything would he have her know his secret after this. She
had thought of him in no other way but to help him.
That was all. He would have to go forth now with a
secret from Constance even.</p>

<p>He studied his text for the coming Sunday, and prepared
himself to preach as he had never preached before.</p>

<p>"Here is an example of how much our people down
here desire a Y.M.C.A., Miss Latham," said Reverend
Jacobs later. "You may recall that, last spring the
colored people of Grantville (which had a population, in
the last census, of one hundred ten thousand people,
almost forty thousand being colored), made a great campaign
to secure a Y.M.C.A." He laid before her a
Negro journal, published weekly at Grantville. She
picked it up and read the whole article.</p>

<p>It went into detail concerning the campaign that was
made to secure a Y.M.C.A. for the colored youth of
Grantville. She had been interested in the campaign
and knew that in a few days, thirty-three thousand
dollars and more had been subscribed. The publishing
house that printed this paper, had issued a daily of
sixteen pages during the campaign, and had heralded the
spirit of the colored people in their liberality. They had
been liberal indeed, but it was only in subscribing. The
paying was different, quite different.</p>

<p>After six months, only something over four thousand
dollars of that amount had been paid in. The building,
equipped, would cost one hundred thousand dollars. A
millionaire Jew, the head of one of the greatest mail
order houses in the country, would give twenty-five
thousand dollars. The white Y.M.C.A. gave an equal
amount. From other sources, seventeen thousand dollars
were forthcoming. The colored people were expected to
raise the remainder. It had been oversubscribed, but
only four thousand had been paid in. Six months had
passed, and she knew (although the paper was optimistic
and had no other thought, apparently, than that the
colored people would raise the amount) subscriptions
would be paid slower now than before. She did not
know what to say when she had read the article.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you realize what they are up against?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said resignedly.</p>

<p>"And they do not seem to know it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It's discouraging."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"It would be no trick at all for any of a dozen churches
in the town to raise four thousand dollars in sixty days in a
rally." She remained silent but listened, and knew that
he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"They have hundreds of churches all over the south,
that have cost, in actual money, one hundred thousand
dollars, and they have paid the amount without assistance
from other sources; whereas, the white people are
offering sixty thousand dollars of this amount."</p>

<p>"And, I gather," said she, in a voice that was listless,
"that Grantville, with its many schools and much more
intelligent colored people, is far more likely to succeed
in such an effort than this town."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"But this place needs it, it needs it badly. It needs
a Y.M.C.A. worse than any town in the south&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the world," he insisted.</p>

<p>"And you do not think it would be worth while to
inaugurate a campaign for that purpose here, before
long?"</p>

<p>He sighed sadly, and then grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Last week, the number of murders exceeded any
previous week for two years...."</p>

<p>"And over one hundred Negro churches have preaching
in them every Sunday."</p>

<p>"And from what I can learn, these murders are rarely
mentioned, in any."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking for a long time&mdash;before you
came&mdash;of a Y.M.C.A. for our people in this town, but
I have never spoken of it. But since I have known and
talked with you, Miss Latham, and have seen the way
our people are conducting themselves, I have been constrained
to take up the effort of securing one." He said
this very calmly, with no undue excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you, Mr. Jacobs?" She made no attempt to
use the clerical term. Her tone was eager, anxious.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated. "I have decided to begin at once,
regardless of the discouraging spectacle of Grantville."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad," she sighed, relieved.</p>

<p>He looked at her, but said nothing. He knew that she
would be glad to hear it. He was glad, though, that
she had spoken.</p>

<p>"Yes," he resumed. "I have discussed the matter
with the heads of three of the big trunk lines operating
in and out of this town, and all of whom have shops
here that hire black men, and, as you might, of course,
expect, they are all in favor of it. They have, moreover,
advised me that they will bring such a movement
to the attention of the board of directors. They have
further advised me, however, that I must not expect to
exceed five thousand dollars from either, and not to be
disappointed if the board failed to give anything at all.
That, they explained, and I understood without explanation,
was due to the financial conditions of the
railroads. I have met the same response from other
local interests. But by them all, I have been encouraged.
Of course, the white Y.M.C.A. are agreeable to giving
assistance as in other towns, and have given me to understand
that they will put in twenty-five thousand dollars.
And then the Chicago philanthropist, of course, has a
like amount awaiting. But the time limit expires in six
months."</p>

<p>"From these, I have gone to our people."</p>

<p>"You went?" She held her breath now.</p>

<p>"To those others, the preachers."</p>

<p>"And they were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Against it, almost to a man."</p>

<p>"God be merciful!"</p>

<p>"Of course, all of them did not say so in so many
words&mdash;in fact, as you might expect, 'Yes, brother, this
town sure needs a Y.M.C.A,' But when cooperation
was suggested to that end, quibbling began. Most of
them, not a bit original, put forward the same excuse,
<i>too</i> busy. All were preachers, yet too busy to save souls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Then, of course, the next excuse was their church was
loaded up with debt; they were now preparing a rally
to raise such and such an amount. And still others had
just closed a rally, which meant their flock was strapped
and would be until another rally. And there are three
churches in this very town that cost equally as much as
this thing, all told.</p>

<p>"Next, I tried the teachers. The professors, of course,
were full of the idea. I found only two, however, who
had paid enough attention to the effort in Grantville,
to know that the people were likely not to succeed.
These, I was glad to hear, spoke of this fact, and we
then discussed the matter from a serious point of view."</p>

<p>"Have you not found ignorance a great stumbling
block?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"The greatest, in a measure, I think. To be ignorant
means, that they will be easily discouraged, when they
discover the obstacles."</p>

<p>"When do you intend beginning the campaign?"</p>

<p>"Sunday. I have prepared a speech to that end for
that day, but, of course, I would have to concentrate a
greater effort before it can be started with any effect.
I have, however, prepared an article, rather, several
articles, and which the newspapers, the white dailies,
have agreed to publish conspicuously. But before we
can expect much from the white people, we will ourselves
have to show greater activity. That is where the hard
part comes. It is hard to arouse the local leaders to any
appreciation of such a thing. There is so much surface
interest, and so little heart enthusiasm. So many will
say a lot of sweet things that mean nothing, not even an
effort to be serious. But I shall open the campaign
Sunday, and I was thinking of asking your assistance in
singing and playing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd be only too glad to help in any way I know
how, but that is so little," she said bashfully.</p>

<p>"We will start only in a small way. I have thought
it best to begin with my congregation. I have been to
them all, and have already secured liberal subscriptions,
all of whom paid a part of it in cash. This I will employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
as a means of stimulating others. So Sunday, at three
P.M., I will lecture on it and ask subscriptions, detailing
first those who have already subscribed."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"What is my balance, please," inquired Mildred the
next afternoon, at the window of the paying teller.</p>

<p>"One hundred fifty," said the cashier, who looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I wish to withdraw it. And you may make it into a
draft, payable to the colored Y.M.C.A."</p>

<p>His mouth opened slightly. He regarded her with a
different look, and then did as she instructed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A fairly good crowd greeted Wilson Jacobs, when he
got up to speak on the proposed campaign for a colored
Y.M.C.A. To cheer the listeners, he asked Miss
Latham to play and sing the song she had practiced, and
which was new to the congregation. She did so, with all
the art of which she was capable, and was pleased, when
she turned to face the audience, that she had given both
pleasure and satisfaction. Her eyes wandered over them
for a moment, and then rested upon someone she had
seen before.</p>

<p>"Where was it," she mused, in a half whisper. Wilson
Jacobs was speaking. For two hours he spoke in behalf
of the Christian forward movement. He made plain in
so many ways, the urgent need of such, and did this
eloquently. He arraigned the high murder record, which
made all of those before him feel alarmed. The time for
some united effort was necessary. Eventually something
had to be done. Plenty of churches, it was true, were
open; but churches were arranged for worship, and not
for clean sport, pool, billiard, gymnasiums and other
amusements in which young men might indulge, would
indulge, and did indulge; but in so many ways and
places, that were not conducted in a Christian manner.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, at the close, "we have decided
to start this movement today at home. We will be pleased
to make an example we hope the other churches will
follow." With that, he read the names of the donors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and subscribers. Among them, one hundred fifty dollars
by Mildred Latham, the organist, led in cash. They
were surprised. Very few had even become acquainted
with her. Now all desired to. When the meeting had
closed, many gathered about her and were introduced.
Then, as she was turning to go, the person she had observed
when she finished playing, approached. His hand
was extended, while his eyes looked into hers with something
that frightened her when she saw him&mdash;and recognized
him as the man she had seen back in Cincinnati,
and who now recognized her.</p>

<p>When she went home that day, she had reached a
decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>And Then She Began to Grow Otherwise</i></p>


<p>The week following Miss Palmer's and Sidney's outing,
was a week of conflictions for her. She was torn by
them considerably. She hardly knew how to feel;
whether to be happy or angry with herself for having acted
as she did. He was kind to her, he was considerate; but
that was all. She had exercised all her wits to make him
see her seriously, but beyond that incident, he had given
her no encouragement whatever. She felt guilty at her
conduct. She accused herself of having acted unbecoming
in her attitude toward him. Although he would not
admit having written the book, which had aroused her
curiosity, she, of course, knew that he had. She had
finished it now, and knew all he had suffered. And, as
she thought it over, time and again, she almost concluded
that his life, as he had suffered, made him hard
and unsympathetic. And almost in the same thought,
she rebuked herself for feeling that way; because, above
all else, he was certainly not selfish.</p>

<p>He called almost every evening when he had finished
his work, and they sat on the porch in the swing if there
was no one, and when there happened to be, they sat in
the parlor on the davenport. And when they did so, it
so happened they began to flirt. And this continued to
develop until it reached a point she declared to be outrageous.
And yet it persisted. At such times, moreover,
she became bold. There came a time when she was
almost disgusted with herself for being so weak.</p>

<p>After a few weeks had passed, she came to realize that
her quest was in vain. Sidney Wyeth had no affection,
beyond flirting, with her. And then she began to grow
otherwise. He observed the change, and was sorry, perhaps.
Still, Miss Palmer did not give up entirely. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
was not that kind of person. After all, to kiss him and
to be kissed in return, was some pastime. It was better
than not being kissed or loved at all. So she flirted.</p>

<p>After this became the usual thing in their acquaintance,
she began to assert other dispositions that had not before
been evident. She inquired boldly where he went when
he didn't call in the evening, as usual. She dictated
where he should go as well. In desperation she continued
her tactics&mdash;even to a point where our pen is constrained
to relate.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said she one evening, when they had
flirted shamefully. "I'm beginning to care for you."
She said this from his knee.</p>

<p>"I did not," he sighed. He was not the least excited
by her acknowledgement.</p>

<p>"I am," she affirmed. "More and more as the days
go by." She smiled into his face, while he looked tired.
"Have you anyone back where you came from, who
loves you and calls you her all?" she asked now, as
though she could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" He looked distressed. "I wish I had,"
he added.</p>

<p>"I know you tell what is not true&mdash;feel you do," she
corrected. After a pause she said: "Do you happen to
have just a little, only a little regard for me?" He made
light of it by blowing her a kiss, and tried to change the
conversation, but she had more to say.</p>

<p>"Of course you wouldn't love an old grass-widow like
me anyhow," she pouted. He was at a loss what to say,
so said nothing.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something?" she said, put out.</p>

<p>"You should not make such remarks," he said, with
a frown.</p>

<p>"But it's true, it's true, and you can't deny it." She
seemed angry now, and didn't appear to care what she
said. She left his knee with a last retort. "And you
men are the cause of it all."</p>

<p>He leaned his head against the back of the davenport
and closed his eyes, which angered her, and she cried:</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, go to sleep. You are the worst person
I ever knew," and forthwith she left the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>When Legs had pawned and lost about all he possessed,
he happened upon a job at one of the hotels, and went
to work. To do so, however, he had to secure a white
jacket, and a pair of black trousers. This was somewhat
difficult on account of his long legs, but he managed to
secure an old pair, and, too glad of the chance to work
where he could fill his stomach regularly, he gave good
service, and was soon on the good side of the head
waiter.</p>

<p>"Say, Books," he cried one day, soon after he had
commenced work. "You should have seen me eat today.
Nice hot bisquits with butter, and dripping out around
the edges, um-um. Man, the way I did eat! I got all
them nigga's t' laffin' over somethin' funny I said, and
then I'd slip back into the kitchen, open the oven and
get me a half dozen hot rolls and butter'm good, and eat,
and eat, and eat!</p>

<p>"There is but one thing I can't seem to get over, and
that is that dollar this nigga Moore got me out of bed
to lose. Say, that hurt me worse than anything in this
world. I've drawn the line on him now though. He
ain't nothing but an old always broke coon, a-moochin'
around for somebody to stake him in a game. I could
have made it all right when I came over here, if it hadn't
been for him. And he never won anything, and kept me
broke as long as I would speak to him."</p>

<p>In a very short time Legs was "on his feet," as the
saying goes. He was making some money and spending
it all. His good resolution with regard to gambling had
been laid on the shelf until further declarations, and he
shot craps whenever off duty, and when he could find a
game. Moore he ignored; but that worthy was as fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of the game as a pig was of corn, so they occasionally
ran into each other, nevertheless. In fact, as Sidney
observed them, almost every Negro shot craps, with few
exceptions. Whiskey and craps were so much in evidence
everywhere he looked, that he drew this conclusion soon.</p>

<p>Now a man lived overhead, and rented from the landlady,
whose name was Murphy. Wyeth called him
"Smoked Irish." He was a creature with a dark record,
so Wyeth was told, and he hailed from a little town in
the state adjoining. Some years before, he had been a
man of considerable importance, but with women and
other pastimes, he had fallen into bad ways, was sent to
the penitentiary for fraud, and had sought other parts
after the expiration of his term.</p>

<p>As Wyeth knew him, he was a "bahba," and shaved
chins and sheared wool in one of Effingham's fancy
Negro shops.</p>

<p>Murphy had seen almost fifty summers, was about
five feet eleven, and a mulatto with coarse, stiff, black
hair, tinged with gray. His features were set, like a man
with experience, and he could tell some wonderful stories.
The Mis' called them lies. They might have been, but
it is to Murphy's credit that they were good ones, and
interesting to listen to.</p>

<p>On Sunday, and week days also, when he was home
from the shop, and in his loft, Murphy sold whiskey on
the side&mdash;or as a side line, and operated a crap game in
addition. The law, of course, did not permit of this, as
we shall see presently; but&mdash;well, it didn't matter&mdash;as
long as the law didn't know it. And Murphy made
money, Wyeth was told. It was up there Legs invested
most of his earnings, winning once in a while, but losing
more frequently. The fact that Murphy was so convenient
with his diversion, was, in a sense, helpful to
Legs, because he didn't have to journey far to his bed.
And always as soon as he was "cleaned," he would retire
and sleep as peacefully as a babe, until his work called
him the following morning.</p>

<p>John Moore was a frequent visitor also. Legs put
Wyeth wise, when he inquired why Moore was up there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
so often, since he appeared to have no money. "He's a
piker, a cheap piker that touts for Murphy, for the
privilege of gambling and gettin' a drink a liquah, that
he loves so well."</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of them all, one Saturday night
about this time, Moore did make a winning. Legs informed
Wyeth to this effect, when he retired from the
battle "clean."</p>

<p>"Seven dollars and a half, the dirty devil. And he'll
be as scarce as hen's teeth as long as he has a dime of it
too." He was mistaken. That was on Saturday night.
Sunday morning after he had risen and had some good
whiskey, Moore dressed himself like a gentleman, and
made some of the losers envy him for a few hours. Then
he went back upstairs to Murphy's. When Wyeth saw
him again, he was sitting under a shade tree, reading the
Bible. This was a self-evident fact that he had made an
investment. As further evidence of the fact, that night
at supper he offered a beautiful prayer. He had failed
to do so that morning, which was further proof of Legs'
contention.</p>

<p>Legs came up while Moore was reposing sanctimoniously,
and said: "M-m! Cleaned, eh! Glad of it, the
cheap sucker. He's dead broke, too. Because if he had
even a nickel, he'd be upstairs. You can bet a nickel up
there. The only thing against it is Murphy's cut. He
cuts a nickel a pass. And sometimes he cuts both ways,
going and coming. So, with men betting a nickel against
a nickel, Murphy is liable to take it all."</p>

<p>Moore retired early that evening, and slept peacefully.
He had worked hard the night before, and that morning.</p>

<p>The following Saturday night, Legs came to the room,
caught Wyeth half asleep, and borrowed a dollar. With
this, he went for a joy ride, and got drunk into the
bargain. Wyeth didn't realize that he had loaned him
a dollar, until the other was whizzing down the street in
the car. And then he was angry with himself. This
disturbed him until sleep was impossible, so, rising, he
betook himself to the porch. As he thought it over, he
became more angry with himself than ever, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
knew Legs had borrowed it for the sole purpose of getting
drunk and joy riding. While he was getting over it in
the soft night air, the Mis' told him Legs had got paid
that day, and, with the exception of what he paid her,
he had lost the remainder of his two weeks' wage in a
game. That made him more angry, and, in seeking a
diversion, he rose, and out of curiosity, he decided to
pay Murphy's den a visit.</p>

<p>Murphy had a good crowd that night&mdash;he usually did
on Saturday. In a room that was near the middle of the
apartment, surrounded by a crowd of Negroes, stood a
table over which was spread a green cloth. At one side
of the table sat Moore, and he called the points and
fished the cuts; while in another room to the rear of
this, with doors open, stood a large refrigerator. This,
Wyeth surmised, was where the liquor was kept. It was,
for, as he was looking, Murphy approached it, opened it,
took therefrom several bottles of beer, and served it to
the many gamesters who were working hard, and perspiring
freely.</p>

<p>The green cloth, which at one time had decorated a
pool table, was, as he now observed, employed to deaden
the sound of the rolling dice, that slid over it from some
perspiring palm. Not any large amount was upon the
table; but many one dollar bills could be seen in the
palms of the gamesters. Another roomer downstairs,
and who read a great deal, was on hand and shot craps
too. This was something of a surprise, since he was
apparently very intelligent; but, as Wyeth learned later,
literary training did not make them ignore the game by
any means. As he stood watching, the dice passed to
Glenview, the intelligent roomer. He made a point, and
then threw seven before he came back to it. The winners
picked up the money. Wyeth was relieved to see the
dice pass to another Negro, who had been fidgeting about
impatiently. He caught them up, and blew his breath
on them, as they were held in his palm, before throwing
them before him across the table. Wyeth advanced
closer as the game became more excited. Glenview had
thrown the dice, much as Wyeth had observed the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
people did back in the <i>Rosebud Country</i>&mdash;for they shot
craps there as well. But now, with a "clea' dy way,
I'm a comin'," he let them roll.</p>

<p>"Throwed eight!" cried Moore.</p>

<p>"Eight I throwed! Now dice, do it again!"</p>

<p>"T' click-i-lick-lick-lick, 'ah eight!"</p>

<p>"Throw-e-d ten!"</p>

<p>"Haf 'e cain' hit!"</p>

<p>"Ah got yu!"</p>

<p>"Qua'ta' mo' I'n make it!" exclaimed the shooter,
hesitating with upraised hand, but shaking the dice in
them the while, and throwing a quarter across the table.</p>

<p>"Ah'll take yu'!" cried a burley on the other side.</p>

<p>"Shoot the dice, nigga, shoot the dice," commanded
Moore.</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-i-lick 'ah-ha-eight!"</p>

<p>"Throwed five!"</p>

<p>"Ain' no eight on 'nem dice!"</p>

<p>"T-click-i-click-i-click 'ah, eaighter from Decatur!'"</p>

<p>"Throwed seben!"</p>

<p>"Ke-hu!"</p>

<p>"Tole yu he coul'n't make it!" cried a big dinge.
"Now gimme dem dice!"</p>

<p>"Bet a quata!"</p>

<p>"Make it a haf!"</p>

<p>"Ah take yu!"</p>

<p>"Shoot the dice, nigga, shoot the dice!"</p>

<p>"Yeh. Cut out d' awgument 'n' let'm roll, let'm roll!"</p>

<p>"Gimme room heah 'cause ah kicks!" He did too.
Raising his left foot he stamped the floor with it, kicking
backward viciously at the same time with the other.
He caught a Negro on the shins, which made that worthy
angry with pain, whereupon he turned, and let the other
have a good one in the usual place. For a time the
game was threatened with a fight; but Murphy, who
appeared to understand them quite well, interfered with
success.</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-i-lick, 'ah, seben ah 'leben!'"</p>

<p>"Throwed craps!"</p>

<p>"Ya-ha! Makin' all da fuss 'n' lose d' fus' shot!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dem dice 's crooket," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Yuz a liah," cried one of the winners, as if afraid
they were, and he would not get his bet.</p>

<p>"Yuse a cheap nigga," said Moore. "Stand aside."</p>

<p>Next came a little Negro, with a nose that began at
the ears, and peepy eyes which observed the dice suspiciously.
He was displeased with the looks of them, evidently.
They were a large white pair, and which, so 'tis
said, can be loaded. He threw them across the table
without making his bet, saying: "Ah gotta paih mah
own," and produced from his pocket, a pair of huge
celluloid ones, that were beautiful in the electric light.</p>

<p>"Haf t' use the house's dice, cain't substitute," advised
Moore, judiciously.</p>

<p>"Why caint ah, I'd lak t' know. Why caint ah!"
he exclaimed, beginning to perspire.</p>

<p>Moore started to say more, but Murphy came forward
now, with "Let me see them." He took them
carefully in his hand, held them between his eyes and the
light, tossed them about, and then threw them on the
table. "They're all right," and walked away. The
little dinge grabbed them eagerly, rubbed them together
fondly, blew his breath on them, and then, raising his
hand above his head, he made a peculiar rattle and
threw them bouncing and jumping across the table.
The Negroes about had been observing him with ill
omen, and now, as the dice jumped before them like
little red devils, they sparkled in the light, and made their
eyes blink.</p>

<p>"Throwed seven!" cried Moore.</p>

<p>"Dogone nigga's 's lucky 's 'e 's ugly," grumbled a
loser.</p>

<p>"Shoot it all!" he cried, hesitating with the dice in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah'll take it!"</p>

<p>"Haf 'e cain' hit!"</p>

<p>"Ah fate yu!"</p>

<p>"Let'm roll, let'm roll!"</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-i-lick, ah baby dolls!"</p>

<p>"Throwed five!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Raise ut t' a dollah!"</p>

<p>"Make ut sebenty-five!"</p>

<p>"Let'm roll!"</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-i-lick, ah, phoebe!"</p>

<p>"Throwed five!"</p>

<p>"Um-m-m-m-m!"</p>

<p>"T-click-i-lick-lick! a-ha dice!"</p>

<p>"Throwed seben!"</p>

<p>"Jes' look ut dat fool nigga, good Gawd!"</p>

<p>"Sech luck, sech luck, sech luck!"</p>

<p>"Shoot it all!"</p>

<p>"Fate dis nickel," begged a loser, with a whimper.</p>

<p>"Trow it out d' windu' shine!"</p>

<p>"Now watch dis 'leben!" cried the guy with the luck.</p>

<p>"Aw, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawdy, jes' look ut dat nigga
agin!"</p>

<p>"Nigga, dem dice yu' shootin' uz sho God crooket!"</p>

<p>"Shoot it all!" Five dollars was the size of the pot
now. It was like five hundred to the eyes that now saw it.</p>

<p>"Whu, whu, whu!" He blew on them; while with
murder in their eyes, the losers watched.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," said Glenview calmly. He placed a
five dollar bill over the amount that lay upon the table.
Several had now gone broke, while others declared
silently, that he was a hoo-doo, and feared to risk him.
Several little bets were made on the side, but no one was
willing to risk much against such luck as he had displayed.</p>

<p>"Now, Anne Jane, bring home du' bacin!" he cried,
as he let them bounce on the table. It seemed an age to
the lookers before they stopped somewhat to the far side.
A six and a five. Eleven. He had won again. There
was no comment now. Every one was silent, and surveyed
him, as if he were the clouds.</p>

<p>"Shoot it all," he cried again. A bit of muttering went
the rounds before any one ventured to cover it.</p>

<p>"'E cain' keep ut up, 'e cain' keep ut up," declared one
who held only three dollars out of a ten dollar bill a few minutes
before. He threw a dollar viciously toward him. After
much parley, others joined; John Moore saw Murphy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
back, eased a dollar from the cuts, and added it to the
pool. Twenty dollars was now the stake, and it was
like a million to those that saw it.</p>

<p>The winner now uncoated himself. He had on nothing
beneath the coat but an undershirt. He flung his
hat in the corner, revealing a little sharp head, shaven
clean and upon which the light dazzled like a smoked
opal. As Wyeth observed him, he was reminded of an
ape, if he had ever seen one. He took plenty of time, as
though anticipating something. Rolling up his sleeve,
he exposed a pair of sinewy arms that made the crowd
exchange glances. Sidney was standing near the window.
At this moment he happened to look out. From up the
street came a sound of merry rollicking. No other
appeared to hear.</p>

<p>The dice were now tumbling over the table in their
fateful quest. More than a dozen pairs of brown eyes
blinked dryly at them, as the red material flickered
beautifully. Wyeth now looked carefully in the direction
of the sound, and finally caught the outline of Legs.
From the distance, he saw that he was loaded. He was
covering considerable space&mdash;so much so that it would
have been extremely difficult to have passed him on the
walk, which was narrow. And behind him came another.
He was about half the height of Legs, as they now appeared.
Wyeth recognized him as the runt, and his
name was Tom Toddy, at least, that is what they called
him about a hotel that was patronized by Negroes, and
where he acted as a sort of goat and flunky. Wyeth had
had his life threatened on one occasion by him. It was
because he had called him "Graveyard." He was old,
bald-headed and measly. So this epithet seemed quite
appropriate. And, thereupon, Toddy had threatened to
send him into eternity, if he addressed him again in such
terms. He had a load also.</p>

<p>On they came, and for the time Wyeth forgot the
game. Toddy was now beside Legs, and they embraced
like man and wife. As Wyeth smiled at the spectacle,
they began to sing.</p>

<p class="center small">
"It's a long, long way to Temporary,"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>and as they came on, they changed it to:</p>

<p class="center small">
"We're a long, long way from home."
</p>

<p>Wyeth laughed now almost outright; but those behind
him never heard. They heard only, and saw with all
eyes, that the apish creature had won again, and had
strapped the crowd to cover the next bet he was now
shooting for.</p>

<p>Legs and Toddy had reached the curbing, and, not
seeing it, they tumbled over into the sand-covered street.
As they picked themselves up, they sang lowly:</p>

<p class="center small">
"You made me what I am today,<br />
So I guess you're satisfied."
</p>

<p>On toward the house they now came, singing at intervals.
Presently they stepped upon the porch, and
rattled the knob. The door was always kept locked
during such proceedings. From the lower end of town,
a rooster crowed long and loud; while, at the same
moment, a clock from some remote tower struck two.
The dice tumbled onward to their fatal end, and Legs
kicked the door a bang.</p>

<p>In the still night, it sounded like the discharge of a
cannon.</p>

<p>Then here came a lull. All became so quiet that the
ticking of a clock upon the mantel sounded like the
pounding of a hammer. Faces turned about and eyes
looked into each other. They were all colors and a sight
to see. The little Negro, coolest all the while, eased the
money into his jeans, as the others cried all at once:</p>

<p>"The bulls!"</p>

<p>And now began the scramble, and it was a mighty one.</p>

<p>Under the table went many, whereupon it turned over,
and revealed them all wiggling like so many eels. To
the room containing the refrigerator, went a half dozen
others and closed the door. John Moore stood in the
center of the room where he had been deserted by the
others, his knees hitting together with a sound like
rocks. Cold fear, for he was an awful coward, held him
like a vise. Into the closets; into Murphy's bedroom
went some more, and piled in a hurry into the bed,
whereupon it gave way with a loud crash, mixing many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
in a nasty, smothered mass, where they tried to extricate
themselves with much difficulty.</p>

<p>And, in the meantime, the kicking continued. "Let
me in! Let me in! What in Hell!" cried Legs, and it
was punctuated with a piping from Tom Toddy.</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;he was very proper&mdash;"open up! Open up!
This is a He-ll uv a way to treat two gentlemen!"</p>

<p>John Moore was still doing the dazzle; but, now
upon hearing the voices, he gathered enough courage to
stand erect, and then he turned hurriedly and running
to a rear window, put his feet out, jumped out full upon
the soft dirt below, and landed without injury, apparently,
for, a moment later, Wyeth heard him running
around the house in the direction of the kicking. He
didn't permit the miscreants to see him, until he had
made out fully that they were not officers. When he
had made sure they were not blue-coats, he advanced
on them from the rear, and took them by surprise. He
appeared unable to frame words of denunciation strong
enough, but at last he made it. His voice was subdued
when he did speak, he was so angry.</p>

<p>"Yeu! Yeu! Y-e-u long-legged nigga! Yeu liver
eatin' bunch a-meat! And you! You little dried shrimp!
Git ready t' die, 'cause 's sho 's I'm a nigga, I'm going
t' part you from this earth t'night!"</p>

<p>They turned now, for a moment sober, and looked at
him. He went on with his tirade.</p>

<p>"Makin' all this noise down heh, 'n' scarrin' everybody
t' death, 'n' a-breakin' up the game! This is wha' you
all 'n' me meets our Jehovah!"</p>

<p>Legs was now too near the edge, and, suddenly with a
catching to save himself, which Moore construed as an
advance upon him, he went overboard with a mighty
tumble.</p>

<p>To this day, however, John Moore didn't know it was
an accident. He didn't wait to investigate. A long pair
of legs, with a long body on top of them was all he cared
to see, and when they landed, he was going around the
corner of the house and into the kitchen.</p>

<p>His hurry up ingress awakened the Mis', who bolted
out of bed, and demanded to know what was up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"The devil's up&mdash;on the front porch, a-raisin' cain."</p>

<p>"What are you talkin' 'bout!"</p>

<p>"That long-legged nigga from Attalia a-comin in heh
a-kickin' on the door, and a-scarrin everybody outta the'
senses!" he told her, much excited, and with his back
against the door, not failing to listen in the meantime.</p>

<p>Wyeth descended the stair now, opened the street door,
admitting Legs and Toddy. Legs entered first, while
Toddy, blinking blindly, followed suit with a grip on his
coat tail.</p>

<p>"Where is he," cried Legs. "I mean John Moore!
I want to kill him! Death for him is the campaign for
tonight! From this earth he's got to part! Where is he!
Show him to me now, and in a minute I'll show you his
heart, the skunk."</p>

<p>In some way, Moore did not hear this; but stood at
the rear looking for Legs from that direction; and, in
the meantime, declaring to the Mis' what he was going
to do.</p>

<p>"I'm go'n throw that nigga out tonight! To-night, or
I'll die tomorra, so help me Jaysus!"</p>

<p>Legs, who had entered his bedroom which opened into
the kitchen, overheard this last. He now tore off his
coat and hat, which Tom Toddy held, and forthwith
sought Moore with a mighty oath. Glenview put in his
appearance now from the rear, and kept Legs out of
the kitchen, which fact sufficed for John Moore to make
words. Our pen fails to describe this in detail.</p>

<p>"Git yo things 'n' go!" cried Moore near the door,
and positive that Glenview was between them. "Leave
mah house at once!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! Hush! Hush!" interposed the Mis'.</p>

<p>"Leave, leave, to-night!"</p>

<p>"Just let me get to him, just let me get to him! I
want to eat'm," begged Legs.</p>

<p>"Yeh; let us have him. We're going t' skin him,"
squeaked Tom Toddy.</p>

<p>"This is terrible," cried the Mis'.</p>

<p>"Just let me get my fingers on the tramp, and it'll be
all over in a minute," Legs begged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"All but the funeral," assisted Toddy.</p>

<p>"Orderin' somebody out of <i>his</i> house. You ain'
nothin' but the flunky anywhere. If I was in charge
here, I'd make you sleep under the bed!"</p>

<p>"I'd make him sleep under the house, the lousy rat,"
cried Toddy.</p>

<p>"Ah said you leave this house now," cried Moore.
"These ah the orders from me. From me-e!"</p>

<p>"The Mis' ain' said nothin'," Legs cried again.</p>

<p>"Leave, leave, before I tear yu' t' pieces," Moore
raved, stamping his foot.</p>

<p>At that moment, Legs gave Glenview a push that
sent him reeling, and with a lunge, he cornered Moore.
That worthy was frightened into Hades. He was speechless.
Legs smiled on him as he reached out and got him
by the ears. Grasping them tight, he essayed a bumping
process against the wall with his head.</p>

<p>"Have you got him, boy?" inquired Toddy, making
sure before he ventured forth with a small knife. "What
shall I do to the sucker now? Just tell me, and I'll
proceed to take off his nose or his lips; either one of
them will make good dog meat."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have come home disturbing everybody
like this," said the Mis', and seemed hurt. This
had effect on Legs, who was always considerate of the
ladies.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, Mis'; but I've had it in for this
hunk a meat, ever since he got me out of bed to lose
my last dollar." He emphasized the remark by another
bumping.</p>

<p>"I'm a poor widow woman without protection, and
you are ruining the only way I have of making a living."
That was enough. He forgot John Moore for a second,
and the next moment that worthy was locked in an
adjoining room. Here he went into a tirade. Legs forgot
the Mis' now and sought him, but the door was
locked and bolted.</p>

<p>"Git yo things 'n' go nigga!" he cried boldly now,
from his safe retreat.</p>

<p>"If you had called, or knocked, I would have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and opened the door, as I always do. There was no call
for all this!" remonstrated the Mis'.</p>

<p>"Don't lock me out, don't lock me out!" Legs raged.</p>

<p>"Git yo things and go, dy'e hear," from the retreat.
Legs now became angry with the Mis'.</p>

<p>"Gimme a dollar Mis' and I'll go. If that thing in
the other woom there is running this place, I don't want
to stay."</p>

<p>"Git yo things 'n' go!"</p>

<p>"Gimme a dollar!"</p>

<p>"You ought to have known better than to create such
a disturbance," the Mis' said.</p>

<p>"Gimme a dollar!" from Legs again.</p>

<p>"Let's get another drink!" from Toddy.</p>

<p>"I've always treated you like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Gimme a dollar!" "Gimme a dollar 'n' a haf!"</p>

<p>"What we go'n give you a dollar 'n' a haf fo'?"</p>

<p>"I paid room rent in advance last Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Now! Here!" cried the Mis', "all of you go to bed
and forget this noise."</p>

<p>"Ah'm go'n git 'n' officer, and have that long-legged
nigga 'rested!" from within.</p>

<p>"Go to bed!" from the Mis'.</p>

<p>"Go'n have who arrested?" exclaimed Legs, mad all
over again.</p>

<p>"'F you do'n git out at once, I'm go'n throw you out!"</p>

<p>"If I ever get my hands on you again, you old cheap
nigga; you old broken nigga; you moochin' piker; you
pot a-neck-bone stew!"</p>

<p>"Say," cried one of the roomers, just then, "a pair
of bulls are coming down the street!"</p>

<p>That was the end of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FOURTEEN_2" id="CHAPTER_FOURTEEN_2"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Disappearing Chin</i></p>


<p>Some years before, back in the west, and at the drug
store in a little town near which Wyeth owned land, and
where, during the cold wint'ry days, the more intelligent
and pretentious, as well as argumentative were wont to
collect and discuss science, politics and economics, a subject
came up one day, that thereafter, became the topic
on more than one afternoon's discussion.</p>

<p>It concerned chins, and grew out of the presence of an
insurance writer, who was booziogically inclined. And,
being so, and a man of no great means, if any, it was a
puzzle to many how he could get the means to fill up on
liquor daily, and pay for it.</p>

<p>The occurrence had remained in Wyeth's memory,
and, afterwards, he had a new viewpoint in observing
people.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick was his name, and he was, of course, Irish.
His ability to get the wherewith to get drunk daily, and
have money for other purposes as well, came up one day
for discussion. The more logical and nature study
debaters, laid it to the fact that he was possessed of an
indefatigable will, and that, in addition, was conspicuously
evident in his chin. Fitzpatrick had a wonderful
chin; one was inclined to take notice of it the first time
he met the man. It extended some distance beyond his
teeth, and was square and firm. A chin that was set in
such a fashion and did not recede, was, they argued, an
evidence of will. So be it.</p>

<p>Chins were carefully observed at once, and lo, the
druggist was the only one with a chin that was inclined
to disappear. It was plain at first glance, that not one
of more than a dozen, possessed a chin the equal of
Fitzpatrick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that Sidney began to see everybody's chin,
apart from every other, the moment he met a person.
When he had come back again among his own, after
eleven years, his observation began to reveal chins, which
according to the argument related, were, to say the least,
discouraging. Almost two-thirds of his people possessed
the disappearing chin. A bad sign, he was positive, but
they had it, and he now studied this race to which he
belonged, very carefully, and from an every day and
practical point of view. He did not attempt a scientific
study, for, in the first place, he knew little of science,
and in the second place, to understand life from a practical
point of view, and to apply one's thoughts and
efforts to that end, seemed to him a more profitable
occupation. In this research, he met many of his people
who had gone through college, knew everything from the
dark ages to Caesar, but many of them couldn't have
bounded the state which they called home, for they paid
little attention to their surroundings. As he became
better acquainted with them, he was disappointed upon
finding them ignorant. At the same time, they had
little appreciation for another's viewpoint, unless he had
<i>been to school and graduated from college</i>.</p>

<p>Having digressed, we will attempt to return to the
story.</p>

<p>The druggist was not an assuming person, and admitted,
very gracefully, to the fact that he possessed
neither will nor determination; but, as Sidney Wyeth
knew his people, he did not expect many to be so frank.</p>

<p>So, it came about that when he met Miss Palmer,
almost the first thing he took notice of when she came
out of the darkness to the porch, was that she possessed
a chin, the point of which was far beyond the lips. It
was that fact more than any other, that caused him to
try in every way possible, to secure her services. As we
have stated, he had little confidence in chinless persons,
a fact, which was so much in evidence among his people.</p>

<p>So, when he had known Miss Palmer a few weeks, and
had been convinced, from a practical point of view, that
she did possess will in keeping with the set of her chin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
he confided the fact to her. She smiled very modestly,
and, of course, deplored it; but, nevertheless, he caught
her studying the reflection of it more than once, when
a mirror was convenient.</p>

<p>That Miss Palmer was determined, vigorous, possessed
courage and had strength of her convictions, was a positive
fact. When she made up her mind to do a thing,
if she failed, it was because it was beyond the range of
reasonable effort to accomplish it. And it was shortly
after this, that Wyeth discovered that such a fortune
could be superabundant. That is, a person could be
endowed with so many of these helpful qualities that it
passed beyond the range of judgment to assert them.
This happened to be what he discovered in Miss Palmer.
He regretted it too, because he had begun to admire her.</p>

<p>The presence of these aggressive facts, began later to
result in a change in their regard for each other. They
disagreed in their point of view, and, still later, they
came to a crash, literally.</p>

<p>For Miss Palmer was, in addition to the agreeable and
admirable things he had discovered, pretentious to an
alarming degree. And it was this, which caused the
trouble.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Our pen has not before had occasion to relate that
the change in the life of Sidney Wyeth, from the prairies
to the present, was due, in a great measure, to the evil
genius of an overly busy person. And yet, such was the
fact. Therefore, being an observing character, and realizing
these qualities, but not appreciating them in the
creature whom he would always despise, he did, above
all else, wish to avoid a person thus richly endowed.
He had declared many a time, that he trusted the diamond
back rattlers that infested the prairies, more than he did
an unduly pretentious, ostentatious person.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he came to notice these qualities in
Miss Palmer, it led to frequent disagreements. And yet,
withal, no one could altogether dislike Miss Palmer.
There came a time when he felt, that if she did not try
to argue on everything that came up, without first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
attempting to equip herself with a few facts bearing on
<a name="the_subject_and_which_would_serve_to_substantiate_her" id="the_subject_and_which_would_serve_to_substantiate_her"></a>the subject, and which would serve to substantiate her
argument, he could have overlooked much of her pretense.
But, as he came to know her better, she argued on everything,
and sought to force her conclusions upon the
other, when her knowledge was quite foreign to the
question on hand. She literally murdered facts. And,
as time went on, he saw that her aim was, very often,
merely to dominate, with no apparent regard for what
might be learned by careful listening.</p>

<p>In Effingham, as in every other town, Wyeth had discovered,
among his people, a set who claimed to be the
more elite; they were the more intelligent, and called
themselves society. On his pilgrimage, he had never
sought to become a part of this society.</p>

<p>In Effingham, Sidney came to see this phase a little
clearer than before, due to his acquaintance with Miss
Palmer&mdash;that is, that side of it, the woman's side. As
for the men, he met that at the drug store, where he had
relieved the druggist of two dollars, and where the more
elite gathered and indulged. Arguments were usually in
process there, he soon saw; and when not so engaged,
they gambled and drank to an alarming degree, in the
back room, and secluded, where he was not invited.
Cards were the custom; but soon craps, he heard, became
more conspicuous. The druggist was "a" shooter,
and won quite frequently, so 'twas said.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer took pride&mdash;as well she might&mdash;in informing
Wyeth of the fact that she was a member of the
colored society of Effingham, and proved it by entertaining
until she was ever bankrupt; she was always up
against it for money; and this fact, no doubt, brought
her to selling books, as a means to make ends meet
during vacation. But Miss Palmer did not, could not,
of course, be expected to admit such a thing. She could
have said nothing about it, which would have been as
dignified; but she made it a point to appraise Wyeth
of the fact, that she only did it to help him, at which
times she would smile, and show her little teeth. "I
like you so much," and she would smile again, "that it is
my great and ardent desire to help you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Sidney had never appreciated it in this way.</p>

<p>At Miss Palmer's could often be found a gathering of
teachers, of which Effingham, with its sixty thousand
black people, had many. And these, to whom the
masses looked to for tutor, he studied very carefully.
He had, as before stated, never shown them the book;
but the surprise of it was, that Miss Palmer had not
done so either.</p>

<p>In one of the little suburbs, where they had canvassed,
he recalled a row of very attractive homes occupied by
the more respectable colored people. Miss Palmer had
canvassed there very carefully, and had sold the book to
nearly every one, but she had as carefully avoided showing
it to a professor, who occupied the most imposing of
the row. He had not said anything, but, of course, he
could scarcely help noticing this careful avoidance of all
houses where teachers lived. In some manner, the
matter came up one day, and Miss Palmer merely
remarked that the teachers were all broke, would be so,
until school opened again.</p>

<p>Sidney had surpressed his criticism. But one day he
called on Miss Palmer. He was just in time to meet a
white woman coming out. The latter turned and thanked
Miss Palmer for her kindness in giving her the list of
thirty teachers, with the suggestion that they would be
interested in the set of books for which she was agent.
The lady had sold to twenty-five of that number, not
counting Miss Palmer, who had cheerfully started the
list. And the books were in twenty volumes, at one
dollar each.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Palmer showed them to her friend
with much ado, stating that the same would be so helpful
to her in her school work. He said it was very nice;
but he wondered just what particular help the books
could be to these teachers, for the set were a collected
list of fiction, with no care as to whether it was a
work of specific interest. The set included many volumes,
by authors who issued a book every sixty days, all of
which were on sale at any bookseller, or by mail at that
time, and for some time past, at fifty cents a volume, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
twenty copies from the publishers at forty-five cents
each.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Palmer did not know this, or any of
the other twenty-five teachers out of the thirty who had
purchased&mdash;and lest we forget, it was this lack of knowledge
that had cost the druggist two dollars, because he
had been shown a work by one of his race, with a suggestion
to buy. The fact uppermost in the mind of
Sidney was, that the teachers with few exceptions, scarcely
needed any such work to teach black children. Many
of them would be unlikely to read as many as half a
dozen of the books in their lifetime. And yet, by borrowing
the book, they were reading <i>The Tempest</i>. Some
were even contemptible in their criticism; but all of
them borrowed it and read it, including Miss Palmer;
and she admitted it was the only book she had read that
season, other than what she was compelled to read by
the board of education.</p>

<p>But all of these people felt they were sacrificing everything
for their race, and would deplore it, were they told
that such was not true.</p>

<p>But the teachers were nice; much more interesting to
talk to than the common herd. They could, almost all,
smile beautifully; and they could pronounce their English
more correctly, employing their "r's," and interspersing
their discourse with a clever toss of the head or
twinkle of the eye; and when one of the race, who had
been successful, married, he invariably picked a teacher.
They were sensible enough to realize that a husband who
could keep the wolf from the door, was a treasure
to be appreciated. It was thus Sidney Wyeth found
teachers. But he could not understand why they seldom
appreciated Negro literature to the point of purchasing,
since they were engaged in the teaching.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer was buying a small home in one of the
suburbs, and which was all she could boast of owning.
As we know her, she secured her living by teaching nine
months in the year, at forty dollars a month. And as we now
know, she must perforce earn something during vacation,
which was the real reason for selling Wyeth's book. So,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
from what we know of her, there is no reason why she
should not have been conspicuous in colored society,
since the masses, unfortunately, are all poor. Hence,
wealth cannot be the dividing line, else there would be
no society whatever.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer showed more ostentation as their acquaintance
lengthened. Sidney was now thirty; and
since nineteen, he had lived on the western ranges.
And, as is usually the case, western people are great
readers. But here, his people did not read. Not that
they could not do so, but because it was apparently not a
preference; considering the fact that few seemed to care
for much reading beyond a newspaper sensation. And,
as he met the more elite, he was surprised that they paid
so little attention to the condition of the masses. Murder,
as we have seen, was an established habit. Of all those
he had met, the teachers impressed Wyeth as having the
least regard for conditions. In other words, "they never
worried." They dressed the best their means would
afford, and aped the rest, which was easy. And this
he found so prevalent, that he was, at times, dreadfully
bored by it all. But he was relieved when he looked
deeper, to find that the people who were actually succeeding
in doing something, paid little attention to this set,
which dominated society. But the set claimed them, nevertheless.</p>

<p>As he had known society from reading of it only, he
had judged that literature was one of its chief features&mdash;but
not so with this. Gossip and hearsay were more in
keeping, and obviously more appreciated.</p>

<p>Wyeth was a literary man now for the sake of gaining
a livelihood; but he had studied it, as we know, from a
modern point of view. He had never, however, any
difference of opinion with them, for so few knew of the
late books, purchased few, and most of them not
any magazines of interest. Not one in a dozen even
read the race's only periodical, <i>The Climax</i>: though the
editor had once been one of them, and had written a
book, a novel. It was a failure, from a financial point of
view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The fiction they knew and talked of was in the order
of Rip Van Winkle, Ben Hur and St. Elmo.</p>

<p>One day, when arguments were abundant, it came to a
point where Wyeth made mention of the fact that so
few teachers showed any interest in current events;
did not read the magazines, and Negro literature they
almost held in contempt.</p>

<p>"Is it because they feel that no Negro knows enough
to write anything they would care to read?"</p>

<p>"The idea," cried Miss Palmer, indignant. "All the
teachers take the magazines, and as for Negro literature,
it has been the teachers who have robbed themselves to
make the same possible."</p>

<p>"And yet other than 'Up From Bondage' and the
works of the dead poet, you can seldom find a volume
by a Negro author in any of their houses.... And, if I
have investigated correctly, ninety per cent of this was
placed there, after the white people had bought it and
proclaimed the authors great. In the many houses I
have been in with you, I have not yet seen any of Derwin's.
Though one of them he wrote, and which is named after
our souls, had a great sale among the white people even."</p>

<p>"I cannot see, nor appreciate either, your point of
view with regard to the teachers' lack of literary interest,
when not two weeks ago, twenty-six teachers among a
list of thirty, purchased a set of twenty volumes each,
and which cost them all that many dollars."</p>

<p>"And every volume by an author few know of, further
than that he was white, and, therefore, knew something,"
he retorted.</p>

<p>It ended there and they were both relieved that it did;
but neither forgot it.</p>

<p>Effingham, with its sixty thousand black people, had
scores of drug stores which sold literature. Many newsstands
also did such a business exclusively. There were
four drug stores operated by colored people, and, like
Attalia, not one sold magazines and newspapers as a side
line; nor did any sell literature, which were operated by
whites that depended upon Negro trade. Granting, of
course, that many colored people bought such at white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
places, when they desired to read, it may reasonably be
imagined how much literature was in demand among the
colored people.</p>

<p>Wyeth usually purchased a work of fiction weekly, and
sometimes more; while some weeks, of course, he omitted
this custom. One day, he was asked by the clerk of the
leading book store in Effingham, what he did with so
many books when he had read them. "We have sold,"
he said, "seven copies of the book you sold us; but I
guess you'll be surprised to know that we have not, as
yet, sold one to a Negro." Wyeth was not surprised,
but didn't say so. "That ad we placed in the colored
paper, and have had standing a month, would bring
dozens of curious white people in to see what it was.
And, of course, some would purchase it to see what was
said. Then, if the contents did not thrill or please,
indifference would follow. But when nobody buys, not
even inquires, we can only feel that your people don't
have much interest in books, and we have had the same
experience before." He smiled when he had finished, a
smile that was embarrassed. He disliked to say it,
apparently, but when Wyeth was so pleasant, he added:
"We have bought what few books your race has written,
for the purpose of sale, and have naturally expected some
evidence of interest from them, by a call and an occasional
purchase. And I am telling you the truth, if we depended
on them to unload this stuff from our shelves, it would
be there yet, as some of it is. You have personally
bought more literature, in the way of current books,
since you came in here, than all the rest of your people
in this town together."</p>

<p>Wyeth went his way then, but he was no longer surprised,
as he once was, for he had heard that many times
before.</p>

<p>One day shortly after, Wyeth happened in at the
druggist's place, the hot bed of argument. He inquired
why a few magazines were not carried in stock.</p>

<p>"Hell!" cried that one, throwing his hands up in a
gesture of despair and mingled disgust, "nigga's don't
read."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The following Sunday morning, when the drug store
was full, he happened to mention a new book he had,
and which many of the idlers were inspecting, one by one,
asking to borrow it when he was through. He suggested
that it was on sale uptown, then quoted the words of
the clerk, who had remarked that he, Wyeth, bought more
books than did the rest of the colored people put together.</p>

<p>He was hooted down, so there was no argument. Each
was positive that his friend had bought one; while that
friend was likewise of the same opinion. And of the
many, almost every one had read the book he wrote,
having borrowed it from someone who had bought it.
The druggist then offered an excuse for the absence of
literature at his store, by declaring that almost all the
people subscribed, and the same came through mail.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer and he were certainly very forgetful.</p>

<p>Literature was a dead issue, that could not be denied;
but whiskey was not.</p>

<p>Effingham had no library for its black people, and they
were not allowed the privilege of the white. Yet a part
of their tax was paid to support the same. Still, no one
gave that much thought, insofar as Wyeth could ascertain.
When he mentioned it to the teachers, almost
without exception they replied: "No use. Negroes don't
read." And it was so everywhere. Yet every class but
the doctors and teachers purchased <i>The Tempest</i>, when
it was brought to their attention, and Wyeth even sold
to three of these (two doctors and one teacher) in Effingham
that summer.</p>

<p>No, no one he met had any worry about a library;
but thousands of black children ran wild day by day
upon their streets, went to jail in great numbers before
they were of age, and filled convict camps as members of
chain gangs long before they could be called even young
men. There was no library, nor was there a park; but
there were plenty of other places conducive to crime.
And still Effingham had more than a hundred Negro
churches.</p>

<p>"Can you not realize, that in your absence of such
necessities for the training of these little black children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
that you are growing children for the chain gang every
day?" But this never aroused any visible concern.
And sometimes they did say, emphatically:</p>

<p>"Aw, we don't need no library; and if we had a park
for colored people, they would do nothing but fight in
it." And still others would cry: "Git religion! 'n'
read d' Bible; pr'pare y'self fo' Heaben." And still
others were in disgust, as they replied: "A nigga ain'
going to 'mount to nothin' nohow, so what's the use?"</p>

<p>"A library could be obtained, if the conditions here
were brought to the attention of the northern philanthropists,"
he suggested to Miss Palmer, whereupon she
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Wyeth, you bore me with your contention
about libraries and parks and Y.M.C.A.'s and the like.
These nigga's in Effingham are not worrying about such
things; so why should you, a stranger, a mere observer,
be so concerned!"</p>

<p>"Because, Miss Palmer, I cannot help but see all this
murder and crime going on, which is undermining the
foundation of colored society. Every day, when my
paper comes, it's murder, murder, murder, and fully
ninety per cent is among our people, although only two-fifths
of the population is Negro."</p>

<p>"Haven't I told you all along, that the crime is among
the low down, whiskey drinking, depraved element, and
not among the best people?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but this country cannot exist in peace and
prosperity and happiness; nor can this race, with the
greater part ignorant, criminal and depraved. The more
intelligent have, for their duty, the task of helping in
any way possible, and by so doing, lift these unfortunates
into a state of intelligence and self-respect."</p>

<p>"Well," she contended, resignedly, "that is for the
churches to do, there's enough of them."</p>

<p>"And the teachers, because they are looked to,
should help as much as they can with their higher intelligence,
for the mothers are too ignorant and too depraved
to do so. But of the many churches, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
seventy are Baptist, not one has any connection or
interest in a school here, directly or indirectly."</p>

<p>"I begin to think you are going to lose your mind, if
you don't quit seeing the many iniquities of our people.
If you would only see what the good people are doing,
and try to interest yourself more in them, you would be
happier," she said. He sighed now, and then said to
himself: "What's the use."</p>

<p>"Quit it all, Sidney," she said softly, calling him for
the first time by his first name. "Quit all this worry
about these nigga's and be yourself; be sweet." And
she kissed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Wilson, Wilson! Mildred Is Gone!</i>"</p>


<p>"Wilson, Wilson! Mildred is gone, Mildred is gone!"
cried Constance, ringing her hands despairingly.</p>

<p>"Gone," he breathed, uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, gone." His sister sank into a chair, and gave
up to a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"But why?" he cried, only now seeming to understand
that she had actually left them.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I don't know," she moaned.</p>

<p>"This is certainly a mystery. Surely dear, you are
mistaken," he insisted, greatly disturbed. "Mildred
would surely not have left us so unceremoniously. And,
besides&mdash;why, she&mdash;she, Constance, why she gave one
hundred and fifty dollars to the Christian association
movement only today. And you cannot mean that she
has gone! It is hardly possible!"</p>

<p>"I only wish it were not so; but come," and, taking
his hand, she led him to the room Mildred had occupied.
It was deserted, save for the furniture that belonged
there. Only once had he seen the inside of it while she
occupied it. And now it did not appear the same;
because then, it was decorated with much lace and
woman's needle work and picture postals. But, strange
as he had thought, when he happened to glance into it
before, there were no pictures of girls and men, young or
old, nobody excepting the picture of the author of the
book which she sold, and which had been taken from the
frontispiece.</p>

<p>"This is the way I found it when I came home a few
minutes ago," she said, resigned. "I cannot make it out;
I cannot make anything out, except that the sweetest
friend, the dearest girl I ever knew, has disappeared
strangely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"She sang at the meeting only a few hours ago, and
sang as I never heard her sing before. She was, moreover,
in the best of spirits all day, and was so enthusiastic
over the meeting. Dear me," he sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"If she had only left some word; given some hint
that she was going to leave, but, of course she knew,
and couldn't tell us, so there is no use at all. She's
gone and I cannot imagine how much I am going to
miss her."</p>

<p>Her brother sank into a chair, and gazed silently at
nothing. He could not think clearly of the departure.
For days he had slaved for this day of inauguration, and
in his work, he had looked forward to her for much help.
Her encouragement, to be near her and to hear her voice
daily, was more to him than our pen can describe. He
had felt that he could face the mighty struggle (which
he knew was now before him) with all the strength of
the strong; but now only, he fully estimated what she
had been to him, and what he had dreamed that she
would be some day. And all that, was now cast aside;
in this one moment, his hope, his greatest hope had
been shattered.</p>

<p>His sister looked at him, and for a moment, almost
fell on her knees in sympathy. For she had not been
blind. She had seen the change coming over him, with
no thought but to encourage him. Constance had faith
and patience and perseverance, and she had felt that
everything would result favorably in the end.</p>

<p>And then she had watched this girl during that spell
of a short time ago. She had seen her appearance change,
as the result of some mystery. Her eyes became dazed
from loss of sleep, due to the worry and subtle fear. It
was then, with great cheer, that she saw it disappear
later, until she was the same again. Constance was
happy then, because the other was happy. She had
been happier still, because she saw that, without effort,
the other was making her brother happy. He had fairly
thrived under it.</p>

<p>Constance felt that his lot was a hard one. She was
confident that he would be a leader of men, in a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
measure than he was at the present. And when she had
carefully observed the practical ability, as well as the
intuition and foresight of Mildred Latham, she had
longed, with all the craving of her heart, for a union
between these two.</p>

<p>And, as she saw her brother now, with eyes dry and
listless, her heart went out to him with all of a sister's
love. It pained her more, when she realized that she
could not help him. She would have to stand by and
say nothing, at the very time he needed her more than
ever before. He was too strong a man by disposition;
he possessed too much will power, and was too proud
to ask or accept sympathy. It would all have to be
given in silence.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. She heard steps on
the porch, and guessed it was the people calling in regard
to the Y.M.C.A. And it was only then she recalled,
that they had been invited to a supper. She called to
him:</p>

<p>"Wilson, some one has called." She went to the door
and admitted a dozen persons, members of the church,
and foremost enthusiasts in the Christian forward movement.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Martin Girsh, principal of the local
high school cried, coming in ahead of the others. "You
are both sitting here at home, when we have been looking
all around for you. And you both show the effect of the
strain you have been laboring under, in this affair."
He said this after he had seen the look upon their faces,
their efforts at self-possession, which they could not hide.
They were glad he saw it that way.</p>

<p>"Where is the young lady, the dear young lady who
showed such an interest in the movement by giving such
a liberal sum?" inquired one, and it was immediately
taken up by the others. It required an effort on the
part of both, to explain that she was out and would not
be back again that evening....</p>

<p>"Isn't that too bad! And all of us were simply wild
to meet her, to hear her sing, and to know more of this
courageous young person," said the professor, with much
regret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is positively a jewel, to say the least. Upon my
honor," cried another, who was a letter carrier, "I didn't
know she was such a treasure until she sang, and when
she led them all in a cash subscription, I declared I
would have to become better acquainted with her."</p>

<p>"I had heard her play and sing, but, indeed, I didn't
know she possessed such a voice before."</p>

<p>"Suppose we arrange a banquet for this young lady,
have her cut in the paper, and let the people know what
a race-spirited young woman we have in this town,"
suggested one. The others took it up by acclamation.
Wilson's eyes found his sister's, with a sickly green
expression. And then he heard them again.</p>

<p>"When can we arrange this, Wilson? It is left to you
and Miss Jacobs to set a date. The incident of this
young woman's contribution to the colored Y.M.C.A.,
can be employed to a great advantage in the inauguration
of this movement."</p>

<p>"Fire, fire, fire!" came an alarm from the street at
that moment. All eyes sought the front, where, directly
across the street and one door down, a large frame house
suddenly burst into flames. Forthwith the visitors
rushed, in a body. A wind was blowing strongly from
the west at that moment, and the conflagration seemed
to draw the flames. It had not rained for some time,
and in an incredibly short time, the beautiful structure
of a few minutes before, was beyond saving. From the
way the flames were fanned by the wind, they threatened
to endanger other buildings.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the place was surrounded by spectators;
while a number of fire departments were rushed
to the scene from different directions.</p>

<p>It was hours later before the flames were subdued.
Only a mass of charred ruins marked the place where the
handsome structure had stood.</p>

<p>Services at the churches were well under way before
many of the watchers left the scene, and the number
included many of Jacob's callers who had, of course, forgotten
their suggestion to entertain Mildred Latham, in
honor of the beginning of the effort to secure aid for the
colored youth of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>As they sat alone that evening, neither Wilson Jacobs
nor his sister offered any comment upon how they were
saved an embarrassing ordeal. They were both thinking,
thinking, and seeing, with their eyes full of tears, a chair
where one had sat and talked and laughed with them the
Sunday night before.</p>

<p>Their hearts were heavy, very heavy, for, strangely
enough, they felt that Mildred Latham would never sit
in that chair again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Beast and The Jungle</i></p>


<p class="center">"REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY AND KEEP IT HOLY"</p>

<p>This was the inscription under a cartoon in the Effingham
Herald, one Sunday, following a Sunday when crime
seemed to have run riot. The cartoon pictured a huge
knife stuck into a human heart, and the moral was, that
on the Sabbath day, when its population was supposed
to be at pious worship, murder was un-Godly.</p>

<p>The Sunday previous to this, seven different
murders had occurred in that many different parts of the
town. Sidney had read the accounts, and said nothing
when he saw they were all black people. Only one exception,
and that was one who had shot another, and in
attempting to escape, had been shot by the police.</p>

<p>Thus was the condition of crime in Effingham. It was
a rare Sunday that didn't have five or six shootings,
killings and cutting affrays. The record for the previous
year showed more than three hundred murders, mostly
by Negroes upon each other, and in part by the police.
Eighty per cent of all murder in the city was among two-fifths
of the whole, or the Negro population. But what
surprised Wyeth was, that insofar as speaking of it as
an everyday occurrence, and something to be expected,
the colored people paid little attention to it.</p>

<p>By this time, Wyeth had become known as a severe
critic. And, therefore, against colored people in their
effort for salvation, so the critics complained. There was
one, however, who saw beneath the surface, and who
said, in reply to the criticisms going the rounds, that
Wyeth was criticised, not for the criticisms, but for his
method of bringing the truth before the eyes which did
not wish to see it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've tried every way possible to obtain a library,"
said one.</p>

<p>"What are some of the ways?" he inquired pointedly.</p>

<p>"Well, for instance, we have asked the teachers to
each give a book for that purpose. We have almost two
hundred teachers in this town, and if each one gave a
book, and the preachers likewise, that would make considerable
of a library."</p>

<p>"For sixty thousand people, yes." And under his
breath he added, "You fool!"</p>

<p>"Why do you not write an editorial and bring attention
to the dreadful amount of crime that seems to have submerged
your population," he said one day to Mathews,
a very excellent writer.</p>

<p>"I'm writing of what people are doing that is uplifting,"
the other returned.</p>

<p>"Do you not consider that all this murder the Negro
is committing, to the disgrace of the state, the city, the
county, and the race to which he belongs, is a thing that
requires some effort, or some comment on our part as
citizens of this commonwealth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but the best colored people don't care to read of
that," he explained.</p>

<p>"But it's a fact, is it not; and one that is going forth
every day through the columns of the big dailies, and a
fact that the public is making record of, and holds up
to the gaze of the world, and gives this town the name
of being the most uncivilized community in the country?"</p>

<p>"There is, of course, Mr. Wyeth, no use in trying to
argue these things with you," complained the other.
"About town, although you have been here only a short
time, you are regarded as a contentious person, always
forcing your way of seeing things upon people, and
criticising our teachers and preachers and best people for
their lack of concern, in regard to a lot of criminal Negroes,
that find their way to this town, from every convict camp
in the state and other states. If you would struggle to
get into society and mingle with the best people, you
would forget what these brutes are doing. Instead of
that, you can always be seen standing at a distance,
viewing all of us as one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Abraham Lincoln, our emancipator, said: 'This
country cannot continue with one part of the people free
and the other in serfdom, and thrive.' I am wholly at a
loss to understand this attitude of what you term the
'best people' toward the masses." Wyeth persisted,
thoroughly aroused. "We complain of the injustice of
prejudice, which is well worth the complaint. But, while
we see that the white people refuse to accept us on an
equal basis with themselves, we cry out about the 'best
people.' We cannot expect the world to accept us as a
race on the reputation of a precious few. And yet right
here in this town, on all sides, among the 'best people'
we hear that 'you' cannot be responsible for the condition
of the great herd. I do not think you are expected
to by the public; but what stirs me, fires me sometimes
to denunciation, is this utter disregard for the evil things
in which our people indulge themselves, to the disgrace
of all."</p>

<p>"Have it your way, Mr. Wyeth," said the other,
resignedly. "That is the reputation you have, 'having
your way.'"</p>

<p>This was the end of that, but not of murder. Everywhere
it continued.</p>

<p>Wyeth went to the churches. He listened to the
sermons; and at the drug store, where the more logical
members of the city could often be found, he met the
same condition. Nobody was worried. Nobody cared.
Just as long as their own affairs were going along in a
satisfactory manner, no complaint was forthcoming.
And, as time went on, Wyeth took notice that everybody
carried a revolver. One evening, at the drug store, someone
displayed a revolver of a new type, which brought
about some comment. Forthwith, among the twelve
present, ten additional revolvers were produced and displayed,
Wyeth being the only one not possessing one.
He was looked at in surprise, and made the object of
much comment.</p>

<p>"Why, I wouldn't go from here home one night, without
my cannon," said the druggist. A prominent doctor
smiled grimly, as he pocketed his, while others laughed
and patted their weapons fondly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"You from out of the west and haven't a gun. Man,
you are crazy," laughed one. "You better send out west
there, and have them send on that dungeon."</p>

<p>"I never owned a gun in my life."</p>

<p>"What! Been living out in that wild country these
many years, and never owned a cannon! What kind of
people do you have out there?"</p>

<p>"Civilized people."</p>

<p>"Uh, well, I ain' never been without a smoker, believe
muh."</p>

<p>"He'll be carrying one before he's here long," laughed
a physician, as they filed out into the night.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>More conspicuously here than elsewhere he had been,
Wyeth saw that the undertaking business thrived better
in this city than any other conducted by colored people.
A half dozen companies were incorporated, with a paid-up
capital stock, and declared handsome dividends
every six months. And each company owned one or
more ambulance carriages, or "dead wagons," as they
were commonly called as they moved busily about the
streets, picking up wounded and dead Negroes. Almost
daily they whirled through the town at break-neck speed,
to the tune of a dreadful alarm.</p>

<p>Then Wyeth began to see, without looking, why crime
thrived. The mills, coal mines and furnaces employed
thousands of men, as we know, and paid them at various
times. And to a saloon they filed and drank their fill.
In his observations, Wyeth had never seen saloons do
such an excessive bottle business. Great cases, the
length of the bar in many instances, and piled everywhere,
were half pints of liquor. A man said to him one day,
"You'll find, upon searching the ignorant Negro, three
things almost any time: A bottle of booze, which might
be empty if you searched him at his work&mdash;a cannon, if
not, it is because he is not able to possess one&mdash;a knife,
with a blade long enough to go through you&mdash;additionally,
a pair of dice."</p>

<p>But it was not at the saloons that they bought all the
whiskey, regardless of the great number in sight. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
barrel houses and wholesale stores were operated in connection
therewith. Here the tiger conductors purchased
their supplies, which consisted mostly of whiskey, and the
cheapest available, which was, to be exact, a dollar and a
half a gallon; but, if bought in smaller quantities, it came
at forty cents a quart; while the beer used by the tigers was
so cheap that finally, no label was used on the bottle. And
it was this kind, he learned, the tiger people used almost
exclusively. It was likewise, this kind that produced the
most fighting drunks, and was sold after midnight&mdash;Saturday
night. So, on the outside of a good supply of drink
and a crap game in sight, crime ran high in this city, and
was ever in continuance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>This Is Mr. Winslow, Madam!</i>"</p>


<p>After his conflict with Moore, Legs took a silent pledge;
he would quit gambling and drinking, and start a bank
account. "I'm going to use some sense and save my
money," he declared, with much sincerity. "There is
nothing like a few dollars, in case of emergency."</p>

<p>"If you stick to that theory in practice, Legs," Wyeth
corroborated, "you'll never have cause to regret it."</p>

<p>He started the same at once, with one dollar. The
next week he added another, which made two, and was
jubilant. The next week he added another, and at the
end of four weeks, had five dollars to his credit, and was
discussing investments. "I'm going to buy me a house
and lot by and by," he said, laughing over his prospects.</p>

<p>"I own the L. &amp; N. R.R.," cried a dirty, black, fat
Negro, coming up the street. "Haf a the A.G.S. too!"</p>

<p>"That's Sam," said the Mis', coming to the door at
that moment. "Ever since a white man took his wife,
they say he's been like that. He imagines he owns railroads,
and if you happen to be going by the station, you
can see him standing gazing at the trains, with a foreign
expression."</p>

<p>"Git that car back on the right switch there! Flag
that engine, and make them push that section to the left!
All right. Now, pull her ahead. That's all."</p>

<p>"How-do, Sam," she greeted him as he came abreast.
He halted a moment, and gazed at her remonstratingly.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Winslow, madam. Always address me as
such, and in that manner hereafter. I am Mr. Winslow,
understand, and I own the L. &amp; N. R.R."</p>

<p>"And the A.G.S.?"</p>

<p>"Own haf a that too."</p>

<p>"And the T.C.I. Company?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"They wanted to sell it to me. I wouldn't buy it.
Come on there with that train, engineer. Drop that car
on siding G. Now, switch that other chain around on
track E.</p>

<p>"Say, Books," laughed Legs. "If you want a get rich,
quit the book business, and run into a train with your
head. That guy is certainly rich."</p>

<p>"He carries on that way all the time," the Mis' explained.
"But he is sane otherwise, that is, he is harmless
and lives with his mother down the street a few
doors. He goes errands, and you can give him as much
as twenty dollars to buy a nickel's worth, and he'll bring
back nineteen dollars and ninety five cents. No one can
beat him, and he is as honest as the most conservative."</p>

<p>"Let's go to a movie, Books," said Legs, when Sam
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"All right," and together, they went down the street
in the direction of the business district. When they had
arrived at one of the three shows, the pictures did not
appeal to them, and they strolled about the town.</p>

<p>The bank, conducted by Negroes, was near the center
of the block, and cornered on the alley, and on either
side of this was business conducted by or for Negro
trade. Within a block of the bank, was located the three
shows; and while operated and owned by white men,
were patronized entirely by Negroes. It was a puzzle
to Wyeth to see his people operating banks with more
success than they could picture shows, clothing stores,
and even hotels. This was the case not only in Effingham,
but in other cities as well. The bank and the
neighborhood immediately surrounding it, was the center
for Negro gatherings, and upon this street might be
found a crowd at any time. Almost every other door
seemed to be a restaurant, and operated by Greeks. In
fact, this line of business was, apparently, monopolized
by these people all over the country. Wyeth saw that
this was due to social reasons. A Greek or an Italian, or
even a poor Jew, operating a business like a grocery store,
or any kind of business, employing less than ten thousand
dollars capital stock, lived much within his means;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
whereas, a colored man in the same business, invariably
was, through the connections of his family, a leader in
society. These Greeks did not even pretend such a
thing, even in a small way among their own, which made
a great difference at the end of each year. None of this
class referred to would think of owning an automobile;
whereas, such an asset is common among these black
people. Hence, a Negro in any business other than a
barbershop, bootblack stand, pressing shop, or business
requiring a considerable amount of practical ability,
was a rare thing.</p>

<p>Being in business, he is looked to to spend more money,
as well. This, Wyeth had found, was not always his
preference; but his wife and family usually represented
the better colored people, and, therefore, are expected to
entertain; are made the object of much flattery and
ostentation. There was one who ran a grocery near Miss
Palmer's, whom, Wyeth recalled, was the object of much
scorn, when discussed. More than once, when he suggested
a purchase of a watermelon, or soda water, or some
refreshment that might be obtained at a grocery store,
he was advised against patronizing the "chinse" on the
corner, meaning the colored grocery keeper. And he
came to learn, that the only excuse for such a reference,
was that he didn't "keep" his wife in society, but made
her "slave" in his little old store along with himself.</p>

<p>For this, he was given as little of their trade as possible;
but, with careful application and perseverance, he was
succeeding to a creditable degree. But the most extraordinary
feature of this was, that the druggist received
no more of this class of trade, than did the grocery keeper,
notwithstanding the fact that he was high in society, and
was positively of their point of view. Wyeth passed
much of his spare time talking with the grocery man, and
came to find him a most obliging man in every way.
When he was informed that Wyeth was selling a book by
a Negro, he instructed him to bring him one forthwith,
and which he was glad to own, and read it through at
once.</p>

<p>So it came to pass, that in all he saw, Wyeth found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
many honest and unassuming people, and whose interest
in the race did not end with a few sweet words and a
shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>Many colored men were actually succeeding in the
grocery business in Effingham, and many of them were
referred to as "chinse's," by those purporting to be
leaders in society.</p>

<p>Getting back to Sidney Wyeth and Legs, who were uptown
for the purpose of attending a picture show. Two
of the three shows were operated by the same company,
and the playhouses were referred to as capital number
one, and capital number two. They were in separate
blocks. Legs and Wyeth had been to capital number one,
and were turning in the direction of the other, when
some excitement was in evidence in that direction.
They joined in the crush, and were just in time to see an
altercation between a man and a woman, a nice looking
woman, brown-skinned, with an unusually heavy head of
hair. The man appeared to have called the woman, and
was desirous of remonstrating with her about something
to which she took exception. She turned to go, and it
was then that, like a flash, he drew a long, keen-bladed
knife from his pocket, and, without a word, drove it to
the hilt in her breast. She walked calmly, perhaps a
half dozen steps, and than, with a sudden clutching at
the air, she cried: "Oh, I'm so sick!" Wyeth saw her
eyes for one moment, and the next, she reeled about, and
fell dead at the feet of the crowd.</p>

<p>The murderer saw her, and it was only when she fell,
that he appeared to take any notice of the fact that he
had committed murder. He now turned and fled up the
alley, while the Negroes about him fell back.</p>

<p>"There goes the beast!" cried Legs, pointing him out
to Wyeth, and the next moment they followed in close
pursuit. A cry from the crowd went up as they disappeared.
It warned them that they would be dealt with
likewise, but they heeded it not.</p>

<p>They ran up the alley that opened ahead into a wide
street. The murderer led them at considerable distance,
and, as they hurried after him, they saw his head turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
from left to right, evidently looking for some opening
in which to escape. But their pursuit was too close.
Arriving at the end of the alley, he halted one brief
moment, and then turned south.</p>

<p>This street fell rapidly a block, and reached a level in
a railroad yard, where long trains of cars stood silently
in the pale moonlight. To these he now ran, not looking
back at his pursuers. A few minutes later, he had, for a
time, disappeared from view behind a car. But determined,
with their blood now boiling, the two flew on
after him. When they got inside the yards, they caught
a glimpse of him crawling along to the other side of a
line of cars, to which was hitched an engine.</p>

<p>A moment later, this began to move, and, suddenly,
while they were yet some distance away, he swung aboard
one of the cars and stood on the bumpers. They hurried
forward, and caught a car each, a few cars to the rear;
while the speed of the train increased. In a few minutes
it was flying, and they were hanging dangerously to the
side. With quick intuition, Wyeth climbed to the top of
the train, and called to Legs when he stood over him, to
do likewise. Hurriedly, Legs clambered to the top. As
he settled panting on top of the moving train, in the rear
and hurrying forward, the light of a brakeman approached.
They darted forward, looking carefully between the cars,
to ascertain which contained the fugitive. The train
now hurried around a bend toward the outskirts of the
town, and, as it did so, they saw the creature drop suddenly
from between the cars and roll over the embankment,
and down the grade which was, perhaps, at this
point twenty odd feet.</p>

<p>The train was tearing along now at a speed that made
it positively dangerous to alight. Still, the light of the
brakeman was only a few cars away, and, inasmuch as
they would most likely be severely dealt with if found,
they were, for the moment, at a loss what to do. The
fugitive had now arisen, and was running again to safety.
All they had seen before the electric show now came
back to them, and, without regard for the risk they were
taking, they quickly clambered to the bottom and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
off the train, just as a curse greeted their ears from the
brakeman above.</p>

<p>A moment later, the roar of the train was lost in the
distance, and they were alone, but, fortunately, uninjured.
The fugitive had, apparently, made good his
escape. Disgusted and disgruntled, they started back
down the track in the direction from whence they had
come. They had gone, it seemed perhaps a half mile,
when suddenly a groan came to their ears. They stopped
and listened.</p>

<p>From near where a few stray hedge and weeds had
grown up and were tangled and enmeshed, they caught
the outline of a man, stretched apparently helpless therein.
They hurried forward, Legs in the lead. As they did so,
he sighed perceptibly. Legs had now reached the man,
and was in the act of bending over him, when Wyeth
grabbed him from the rear and jerked him quickly back;
but he was in time to save him from the other, who had,
like a flash, sprung up and lunged forward with upraised
knife.</p>

<p>Having missed, the murderer tumbled forward on his
face, and bit the cinders, while Legs raised himself off
Wyeth, who had been pushed backward and down by the
sudden collision. The other had gained his feet, however,
before they got their wits together, and with a mad
curse he tore down the tracks. As Wyeth raised himself,
his fingers encountered a piece of cinder, heavy with
iron. Unconsciously, his fingers encircled it, and when
they again started in pursuit, he grasped it.</p>

<p>"We'll kill that beast as he killed that woman," cried
Legs, panting dreadfully, but more determined now than
ever. With a clear track, and nothing to obstruct the
speed, it was now evidently only a question of minutes
until they must surely overcome the other who was
shorter, and whose speed had become noticeably slower.
Legs had got within a few feet of him, when suddenly
he stopped short and whirled about. Too late! Legs
seemed doomed to meet the point of the upraised knife
that glistened in the moonlight. Wyeth at that moment
saw the danger of his companion, and, with a cry, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
hurled the cinder full at the crouching fugitive. It went
straight, and took the beast full in the face. With a cry,
the other fell backward across the track.</p>

<p>Legs tumbled over his prostrate form, while, at that
moment, from down the track came the sound of an
approaching train. Both now looked up, and it was only
then they were aware that it was so near. They were
blinded by the light, but with a cry they sprang free, as
the light fell full upon the face of the fugitive, who at
that moment came to his senses. He staggered forward,
and then with a cry that rang above the roar of the
train, he stumbled forward, but in rising, one of his feet
had caught in a frog and held him fast. A screwing of
brakes could be heard, but in a moment the heavy engine
crushed over his writhing body, and mangled him until,
when he was taken from beneath it, he could not be
recognized.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Legs and Wyeth were present the next morning at the
inquest. There was no visible excitement over the death
of either. A small paragraph at the bottom of the back
page of the morning paper reported the death, by stabbing,
of a Negro woman; while a still smaller one made notice
of the death, in an unusual manner, of the murderer.</p>

<p>And so it was in Effingham. If one desired notoriety
he had to do other than kill a Negro, or be killed by one.
For such was soon forgotten among other and more unusual
sensations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Thou Shalt Not Steal!</i>"</p>


<p>During Wyeth's canvass among his people, he had
become accustomed to regard men who indulged excessively
in drinking, as a problematical feature. And
when that same man gambled, in addition, and failed to
keep his word or oath, he was not in the least surprised.
And, moreover, when he became acquainted with a person
who loved liquor, gambled likewise, and who did not
struggle to secure a job, but was content to walk about
in perfect peace, without any effort in that direction, he
was not surprised if that person stole, in addition.</p>

<p>The people he stopped with were, in a measure, secretive.
That is, they did not always take the trouble to
state where they purchased all they had about the
house. He took meals with them occasionally, and saw
them eating every day; and, although chicken was very
high, exceedingly high in Effingham, they had it every
day.</p>

<p>The druggist, whose store was a block distant, had
inquired of them, and made known the fact that Moore
was indebted to him two fifty, but Wyeth paid little attention
to this, since, during the warm afternoons, under the
cool of the electric fan, he indulged in such reminiscences,
and Wyeth knew almost everybody who owed the druggist
anything, including Miss Palmer.</p>

<p>Two robberies had occurred in less than two weeks at
the place, and both were shrouded in mystery. The first
had been explained away very reasonably. A window
that was almost hid by vines had been left open, and
through this, a "nigga," as they put it, had made his
entrance and gotten away, carrying with him a suit of
clothes belonging to one of the roomers, who kept himself
pretty well soaked with liquor; this roomer hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>pened
to be employed at a wholesale liquor house, and
was, therefore, able to drink with economy. Sam was
his name, but he was not, however, the one who owned
the L. &amp; N. R.R. But Sam was an easy go-lucky and
didn't care whether school kept or not; and, likewise,
didn't make a big noise if something did crawl in through
the window, and steal a new thirty-five dollar suit.</p>

<p>As was stated, it was explained, John Moore lost an
old derby the same time&mdash;at least, this was how he
reported it. The green stain upon the window-sill, from
the vines his knees crushed, was further evidence of the
ingress and the egress. Considerable indignation was
shown by Moore, and a great many words were employed
over the affair; but, in due time it had died
away and was forgotten, when the second came to pass.</p>

<p>The victim this time happened to be a gloomy and
forlorn creature, who could well boast that no miscegenation
had prostituted his ancestors, and whose teeth, in
the night, flashed like a diamond necklace. Griffin was
his name, and he did not shoot craps, or fight, or get
drunk, and Wyeth didn't think he drank, until he saw
the Mis' go to make his bed one day, and, in turning
back the pillow, revealed a half pint of John.</p>

<p>Griffin reported that it was employed as a medicine,
and Wyeth allowed it to go at that, but indulged a smile
upon Griffin that meant more. Wyeth had a way of
joking with the eyes that kept him out of difficulties, but
convicted and judged those near him, and they could
only laugh and look guilty.</p>

<p>One of the other good things we know of Griffin, is
that he read the Bible, and nothing else, and said so;
moreover, he deplored the reading of anything else,
declaring it to be contrary to the laws of God. Griffin
rarely said Jesus, and never "Jaysus." And&mdash;yes, he
was a Sunday school teacher, and went to services to a
church that was at the other side of town; he shouted
when the preacher delivered a soul-stirring sermon, and
expected to go to Heaven when he died. Only one thing
did Griffin indulge in, though he was careful to keep that
to himself, and that was woman&mdash;but we are a long way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
from our story. And still, we cannot leave it, this part
of it, until we make known that she was a "high yellow"
which is perhaps unnecessary to state, for when the color
is like Griffins', they scorn all other kind.</p>

<p>The robber this time employed a more machination
method, and he was a very congenial robber also. Out
of consideration for Griffin's regular attendance at
church, he left an old greasy suit that, due to the great
amount of the foreign matter it contained, was likely to
last him until finances would enable him to restock for
the benefit of the robber.</p>

<p>This robbery occurred one night when he was away,
and did not return until the following morning, which
was in itself singular, for Griffin was rarely away. It
was, like the other, mysterious. Griffin was a miner,
and since he would not&mdash;so 'twas said&mdash;pay twenty-five
cents a week for warm water and a towel to clean himself
at the mines, he preferred to sleep in the kitchen, because
he was unfit to occupy any other portion of the house,
unless it was the attic. And since there was none to this
house, we leave him in the kitchen, where he slept in a
dirty, but warm bed, and kept his clothes&mdash;he had some
pride&mdash;in the strongest trunk Wyeth thought he had
ever seen. On the outside, he kept it locked with the
strongest Yale spring. With all the high-priced advertising
done in regard to the safety of such locks, this
robber didn't seem to give a hang, but, with a steel
poker, he had twisted and twisted, until Mr. Yale had
resigned himself to the inevitable, and permitted ingress.
Within were four nice, clean suits, awaiting Griffin's
subtle occasions.</p>

<p>Legs, Wyeth and Glenview, who were very agreeable
roomers, didn't hear of it until the second morning.
And they might not have known then, if it had not
happened that they were together in the adjoining room,
and overheard Griffin crying over the loss. That happened
to be Friday. Legs had become something of a
hero, with his successful running down of the murderer,
and now played, very successfully, the part of a man.
Legs did not positively condone the light fingered method.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
When they had been led, by their curiosity, to investigate,
and had returned to the room, he remarked:</p>

<p>"It beats Hell the way this place continues to be
robbed!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed singular," commented Glenview, whose
English was always the most careful. And he never
swore.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Legs again, "it <i>is</i> strange. So strange
that I'm getting suspicious," and he closed an eye
meaningly. "There's a man in the house who has not
worked this summer.... He cannot <i>seem</i> to get the
kind of work he follows, true; but the fact to be considered,
is that he <i>has</i> not worked this summer. He
likes to gamble, and is particularly fond of liquah...."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and he closed that eye again, and
looked across at Glenview. Glenview closed an eye and
looked at Wyeth. Wyeth held his open, but did some
rapid thinking. He now recalled that, upon entering,
the robber had cut the screen, it was shown to them;
but now as he remembered it, the ends of the wires where
the screen had been cut pointed outward.... Also, it was
reported to have been cut with a hatchet; and the
hatchet was on the ground near the window, which was
logical.... It was very strange indeed, this robbery....
Legs was speaking again:</p>

<p>"This man who has been out of work all summer, at
least has not worked all summer, and who loves liquah
better than I do, and who could shoot craps forever and
be happy, sleeps within four feet of that trunk. The
only thing between him and the trunk is a door that has
not been closed this summer.... And who, moreover, if
you will recall," he closed that eye again and held it so a
second, "awakens always when we enter late at night,
and inquires, 'who goes there.' <i>And this man slept
through all this with the trunk almost against his head, and
didn't hear it being opened.</i>" He paused again and closed
that eye, it was the right; Glenview closed his left,
Wyeth closed his too. From the other room came sighs,
and a restless turning on the bed where some one lay.
On the front porch, John Moore sat with the Bible open
before him....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you observed," said Glenview, in his Englishy
way, "that the ones who have been robbed, are those
most likely to take <i>his</i> story about it, and are not capable
of investigating on their own initiative?" Three eyes
closed simultaneously. "For instance," he resumed,
"there's Sam, always full you know; when I inquired
what he had done about it, he replied that he had inquired
of one pawnbroker&mdash;and you know there are perhaps a
hundred in this town&mdash;if any one had offered a suit as
security for a loan that fit that description. Think of it!
And now here comes the instance of this old creature we
hear sighing in the kitchen; and who reads nothing but
the Bible, and goes to church on Sunday. He hasn't
sense enough, and nerve, he doesn't know; he has perhaps
called on the Lord to restore those things. Why
haven't some of our things been stolen?" ... Again
three eyes closed, while memories became the order;
the memory of Wyeth's conflict, and they didn't forget
that of Legs. "We leave them laying around, and none
of us lock our trunks.... You," he said, seeing Legs,
"have more suits than any of us, and they hang on the
wall...."</p>

<p>John Moore had fallen asleep and the Bible had tumbled
to the floor. A street car line came past the door, and
the cars, when passing, filled the house with noise. One
passed at this moment, and he was suddenly awakened.
Looking about hastily for the Bible he had held, he saw
it on the floor at his feet. He stooped to pick it up,
and as he did so, saw that it was open. As his hand
touched it, his eyes lit upon a chapter, whereupon he
straightened up quickly. A moment later he picked it
up, and rising, entered the house.</p>

<p>The words of the chapter that had disconcerted him
for the moment were: "<i>Thou Shalt Not Steal!</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_NINETEEN_2" id="CHAPTER_NINETEEN_2"></a>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>

<p class="center"><i>They Turned Her Out of Church</i></p>


<p>Saturday night of that week was a beautiful night, and
everybody sought the open air&mdash;no, almost everybody.
There were a few that didn't, in fact they sought the
closed inside for a purpose.</p>

<p>Murphy had a good crowd, for it was pay day, and
everything was "sliding" along O.K. Glenview, who
had purchased a new novel from Wyeth, who bought
them and sold the same at a discount when he had read
them, was there too. So was John Moore, <i>he</i> was always
there. Wyeth was below, and so was Legs, for, strange
as it may seem, he had kept his pledge thus far. He was
glad of it, too, which is ahead of our story. Easy.</p>

<p>A game was on, a big game, and darkies were uncoated;
perspiration flowed freely. Wyeth retired about
twelve, or it might have been earlier&mdash;it makes little
difference. The game was on, and so was somebody else.
Wyeth felt himself being shook, but could not seem to
awaken at once. Words came to his ears, and it was the
voice of Legs that spoke:</p>

<p>"Get up," it said, in subdued excitement. "Get up,
you fool."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil! Are you crazy? Don't awaken me.
I'm tired and want to rest," he answered unconsciously.</p>

<p>"I said, arise&mdash;at once. Somethin' doin'."</p>

<p>"Will you go to the devil, or shall I hit you in the ear
and dispatch you forthwith! I want to rest, you pair of
Legs."</p>

<p>"Listen! Listen! Hear them, Books!"</p>

<p>Books heard something, but he didn't know what it
was; moreover, he didn't care&mdash;in fact, he didn't want
to hear. He wanted to sleep. It was a fine night for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
sleeping, too. The soft air floated in through the window
at his head, and the vines and garden the Mis' raised,
and which grew within a few feet of him, perfumed it
with nature's own. Why should he be concerned about
what went on up in Murphy's den. He kicked at Legs,
when he repeated.</p>

<p>Legs went into the other room, but the noise from
above persisted.</p>

<p>"Look out there, nigger!" it said. "Don't start
nothing, don't start nothing! Get around there, you,
beside that other nigger! Now, here, you, ink, put these
cuffs on the two niggers against the wall. Right around
the wrists, you fool. I've put them on you often enough
for you to know that they don't go on the shoulders.
And don't be so damn nervous. You shiver around
there as though it was the first time you've been arrested.
Are you done? Well, stand over in that row beside them
other niggers! Don't think because I know you that you
c'n ease out that window. And don't figure I'm going
to play any pets! Heah! Heah! You little black rat!
You, I say, with the pop peepers! If you try any monkey
foolishness, I'll put'm out, I'll put'm out! Hear that
nigger, hear that! I'll shoot you nigger, I'll shoot you!"</p>

<p>"Hear'm Books, hear'm! It's the police. They're
upstairs. They're making a raid. Hear'm Books!"
came Leg's voice, as he came back to where Wyeth lay.
Sidney had awakened now. Sitting up in bed, he listened
to the voices that came down from upstairs. It was still
a little vague, but Legs spoke again:</p>

<p>"They are coming down now." And so they were.
A noise of many feet tramping about, began to file downward
on the rickety steps.</p>

<p>"Wait, Frank," came a voice. "Let me out on the
front, so I can hold a gun on these niggers. Now come
ahead. Now, niggers, the first one that makes a break,
remember, out goes his light, bingo!"</p>

<p>"Mary, oh, Mary, bring me my coat and hat." Wyeth
was dressed now and peeping out the window. Yes, it
was John Moore, and he wanted his coat and hat. He
was going away, on a journey. The Mis', very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
frightened, hurried forward, and held them out to him.
He placed the hat on his head, and took the coat on his
arm. He wore cuffs, so that made a difference.</p>

<p>The Mis' fell into the room a moment later, and gave
up to silent anguish. It was not the first time she had
witnessed a raid. Sometimes Wyeth felt sorry for her.
For, once upon a time she had been a good woman, she
was yet when she could be. At least she was always
kind; but when liquor was voted out of the state some
years before, he, her husband then, took up the sale of
it, contrary to the law. He had been caught once, and
then twice. He had then been caught the third time.
The third time is when you go to the mines. You may
never return from these places, so 'tis said. "They kill
you out there," is what John Moore had told him once,
grimly. "Yes, they <i>kill</i> you out there. It's <i>Hell</i>!"</p>

<p>They killed the Mis's husband. And she had a son,
and he sold liquor too. He was a dissipated youth. The
mines had him six months. They gave him back to her.
T.B. He died. And at this time she mourned his loss.
She was now alone in the world. She had, at first, made
an honest living, and was a member of the A.M.E.
church. She became acquainted with John Moore.
Well, they turned her out of church some time afterward.
They would have done so sooner, but she was
pitied, and black people have sympathy&mdash;even for criminals.
The Mis' had lost her husband, and then her son
and&mdash;but they turned her out of church. That's bad.
Oh, it's awful bad to be turned out of church. Black
faces, crooked often, regard one with dark suspicion when
he is turned out of church, especially if a woman.</p>

<p>And now they had <i>him</i>. The other, her consort, for
such he was, because you see, be merciful, she was a
human being.... And all human beings cry out for love,
yes, <i>love</i>....</p>

<p>"Take along his Bible, Mis'," grinned Legs. And
then he looked at her.... Yes, Legs knew the story
too.... He was sorry, terribly sorry. They were all
sorry for the Mis'.</p>

<p>Legs and Wyeth now stood on the outside. It was
safe now. They watched the arrangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Four abreast they now stood lined in four rows. They
were all handcuffed together. John Moore was there,
bringing up the rear. Murphy was, too. Being the man
of the house, he was honored with a place at the front.
And behind these sixteen men, walked his honor, the
police. And so very insignificant they were, apparently.
Yet, they were the <i>law</i>! And that means more than our
pen can describe here.</p>

<p>Black people claim to fear God and no other. They
don't. The most of them do not understand it in a
larger sense. No. But, notwithstanding the fact that,
in Dixie they are forever breaking it, they <i>do</i> fear the
law&mdash;and the white man.</p>

<p>They filed now, a row at a time, and a few feet apart,
across the street. Under the flaring electric street lamp
they passed, some bareheaded, but all downcast, discouraged
and remorseful. Oh, this was the law. The
law of Effingham declared: "Thou must not game!"
In the middle of the street they walked, and a few minutes
later, they passed under the light of the lamp at the next
intersection, and disappeared in the direction of the
station. And it was only then, Wyeth recalled, that
among them he had not observed Glenview. He was
not there, he was positive; and yet he was at the game.
Where was he? Where did he go?</p>

<p>He turned his eyes in the direction of the rear, and at
that moment Glenview walked into view.</p>

<p>"You!" cried many voices, for a curious crowd of
crooks had gathered. Good people had long since retired.</p>

<p>"Well?" he smiled.</p>

<p>"Well...."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>here</i>. Not <i>there</i>!" And his eyes went in the
direction of the others, who were now passing under
another light, into a bigger light.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I saw they were nothing but a pair of snots."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The window was open."</p>

<p>"The window?"</p>

<p>"And the <i>outside</i> air was <i>very</i> inviting. Much more
than that <i>other</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh...." It was becoming clear to all now. The
Mis' looked disappointed. Sometimes she had not liked
Glenview.... He winked and went to the front of the
house.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the Mis', resignedly. "They certainly
got a bunch of them," and then laughed, a laugh that
Wyeth had heard before and knew. Not a cheerful
laugh, but a dry, hard laugh. One that was possible
after years of bitterness.</p>

<p>By this time, a score or more Negroes, denizens of the
night, had gathered and were exchanging opinions, offering
theories, and executing objections.</p>

<p>"Some low down nigga done turned'm up." This was
what a large Negress, with imposing hips, was saying.
She sold liquor across the way, and conducted a house
for any kind of purpose.</p>

<p>"Some doity li'l' stool pigeon," added another, who
was more doubtful still. Wyeth regarded them a moment
in disgust. They were dressed as they were when they
arose that morning or that afternoon, or whenever it was,
which was not in the last hour or two.</p>

<p>It was Glenview who detailed the raid now at some
length. "A big Negro was shooting for three dollars. A
little guy, who appeared to be very drunk, kept making
a fuss, finally asking to be let out. He went, and when
Murphy opened the street door for that purpose, well, in
walked the bulls&mdash;no, the little snots."</p>

<p>"I'm going upstairs to see how it looks after the
scramble," said he, and a moment later his feet were
heard in that direction. He had no sooner hit the landing,
than from above came a dreadful noise. A crashing of
window panes indicated that someone was trying to get
out of the window. A table turned over with considerable
objections, judging from the noise it made. The
whatever-it-was appeared to be coming toward the stair
in post haste now. Chairs were cast aside, without care
of how they might land, and then it appeared on the
landing. A moment later it came down, much a tumble,
and not in the usual way. Hands and legs and feet
seemed altogether, as they did many stunts on the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
down. Eyes were opened wide, while breaths were held,
as the spectacle was observed closely. And then it landed.
One moment it lingered, and made a funny picture for
the many eyes. Then it became erect&mdash;and behold!
It was a man.</p>

<p>But he hadn't taken the time to dress entirely. He
had, upon coming down, or deciding to do so, donned
only a coat; while his large, loose knee lengths stood out
conspicuously from the small legs, that reminded one of
pipe stems, smoked ones&mdash;coming out of huge corn cobs.</p>

<p>It came about when Glenview ascended the stair, and
met it in the act of looking about to ascertain whether
the coast was clear.</p>

<p>For a time that may have been a second, possibly more,
he stood hesitant. Wild of eye and trembling in the legs,
but conspicuous to a humorous degree, he soon came to
appreciate the spectacle he made, and forthwith betook
himself hurriedly back up the steps; but, alas! Not
many had he ascended when he made a miss, and, with
a smothered, embarrassed cry, he fell, and the next
moment came back.</p>

<p>While all this performing was going on, he was not
aware that the officers had long since departed. And
when he again landed at the feet of his onlookers, who
were now given over to a fit of snickers, he cried in a subdued,
but intensely excited voice: "Don't let them get
me! Don't let them get me!" He was wild, as he hesitated
before attempting to return. And in the meantime,
he whined like a poor thing, which made the Negroes
who stood about, give up to loud laughing.</p>

<p>At last, he was calmed to a point where he took himself
hurriedly up the stairs, and disappeared. And then
there was another commotion! Apparently the house
was coming down, from the scrambling, and the way
chairs, and beds, and tables&mdash;and everything seemed to
be turning over.</p>

<p>"Say, say!" came the voice of Glenview. "The
officers have disappeared a half hour ago. Be quiet.
Those are not officers below. They are curiosities." But
it was some time before he was able to communicate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
fact to a point that brought quiet. When he presently
emerged, the onlookers saw not two, Glenview and the
other, but five. They slipped down the steps like ghosts,
looked wildly about for one brief second, and then
melted into the night like vampires.</p>

<p>As they floated away, some one recognized one and
called him out by name, and these words came back to
those who listened:</p>

<p>"Hush calling my name, you fool!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The plate at the head of the table was not turned that
morning. The Mis', notwithstanding the words she
uttered when the raid had been made: "I'm glad of it!
It'll stop that gambling, and I hope, Murphy's whiskey
selling," she was, nevertheless, sad-eyed, and all upset.
All that day she so remained, grew worse, if anything.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mis'," comforted Glenview kindly. "As
soon as some word comes from them, I'll hustle about
and secure bail." But it was late in the morning before
any word came, and then, alas! It was a surprise.</p>

<p>There is a law in regard to gaming in Effingham, which
makes the penalty heavier if caught gaming during the
week; whereas, it is lighter for Sunday. Therefore,
being well aware of the fact, no serious anticipation was
held as to how the gamesters would be dealt with, since
they had been caught after midnight Saturday night.
In fact, when the excitement attendant with the raid had
passed, those directly interested, looked hourly for those
who were caught, to be released.</p>

<p>"What'll it cost them under this law?" inquired Wyeth
of Glenview, who appeared to be fairly well informed
regarding the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, not much," he replied. "Perhaps five or six
dollars. You see," he explained, "the city considers
gambling through the week as a business indulged in by
professionals; whereas Sunday, they construe that they
may be workmen engaged in a pastime."</p>

<p>Wyeth understood, of course, but it appeared singular
at first.</p>

<p>"They will be taken to the city lock-up," Glenview
resumed, "and if collateral to the amount of twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
dollars be offered and approved, they will be allowed
to return, and when they appear tomorrow morning, they
will be fined five dollars and cost. If they were caught
during the week, it would be ten and cost, and possibly
more, depending."</p>

<p>It was at the end of this conversation that they got
their surprise.</p>

<p>Murphy came in. He seemed tired and worn; he was
a picture, in fact, of the result of such a raid. He sat
himself down with a sigh that was not altogether one of
relief. All waited, with drawn breath.</p>

<p>"That's the worst place I have seen the inside of," he
said, and shook his head in emphasis.</p>

<p>"Where did the wagon pick you fellows up?" inquired
Glenview. "I don't recall hearing any."</p>

<p>"No wagon picked us up. We walked all the way.
They didn't carry us to the city pen, but to the county
jail."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the Mis', while Glenview appeared to
regard it with incredulity.</p>

<p>And then all were silent, with a cold feeling creeping
through their veins, as the grim reality came upon them.
It would now be thirty-seven fifty, and not five dollars, for
the county made no exception for Sunday.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>All the day through, John Moore raised from his hard
seat, and gazed out through the heavy bars that penned
him in. "Will they never come, will they never come!"
he cried to himself, but only the heat and multitudes of
Negroes greeted his gaze, as it eagerly sought the door
to freedom.</p>

<p>And all day Glenview walked from one bondman to
another.</p>

<p>"No," said the wealthiest Negro doctor, who had
bailed out many. "I've quit going anybody's bond. I
don't think, from the experience I have had, that I
would be justified in going my brother's hereafter." He
had a few to jump them, and it cost him a pretty penny,
he afterwards told Wyeth, to get them back.</p>

<p>"He's worthless," said the druggist, apparently amused,
at least satisfied with his solution for the present. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
owes me two fifty for medicine I sold him, and trusted
to my sorrow. But I'll tell you what I will do." He changed
his tone to one of thought, then went on. "Now
you tell the Mis' if she will come down here and give
me seven fifty, five of this is going the bond that'll put
the thief on the street, because it is he who has been
doing that stealing up there, and all of you don't seem
to know it, and the remainder, two fifty, is what he owes
me. Tell her to bring it to me in cash, understand,
the long green, and out he comes, to go back soon where
he ought to be, for he has honestly no right to be free."</p>

<p>Of course, Mis' never had such an amount, so Moore,
insofar as this source was concerned, was doomed to stay
in the hot place for some time. Glenview went to another.</p>

<p>"That nigga! Hell! Why I wouldn't go his bond to
stay in Heaven, he is so crooked and undependable."</p>

<p>That was the end of it for that day, and the night
settled down.</p>

<p>It would cost ten dollars cash to secure release through
professional bondsmen; and, inasmuch as John had
not the tenth part of that, he reposed for several days
in his new place of abode, and became very dirty and
bedraggled in the meantime. Always so clean and tidy&mdash;thus
the Mis' kept him, that he was hardly recognizable,
when a few days afterward, he returned. It was Murphy
who secured bond, and Wyeth came upon him in some
surprise that evening. He sat quietly on the porch with
the Bible in his hand, so, greeting him, Wyeth asked how
he "liked" it. The other said:</p>

<p>"Whew! The worse place I was ever in." He had
been in them before, but not this one; but he did not,
of course, deem it necessary to make this mention. It
had been made by others. "Two hundred nigga's in the
room I was in, and God knows how many more elsewhere.
And they were one-armed and one-legged, one-eyed
and toothless, earless and one-eared; but the whole
bunch, every one of them, were filthy. And the place
was rotten!"</p>

<p>Yet more than five hundred Negroes, most of them
young men, preferred the place to freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>"I Love You!" She Said</i></p>


<p>Miss Annie Palmer had about despaired of winning
Sidney Wyeth, and by this time was not nearly so considerate
when he called, as she had been some weeks
before. And, besides, Wyeth had an insistent way of
seeing things, which was not the custom of her friends.
When he called, sometimes, instead of giving up to the
easier things in life, and which concerned the select few,
he was liable to bring up a subject concerning the future
of the Negro of the south, as he is today, etc., etc., etc.
So it came to pass, that Miss Palmer was only good at
times; and at those times, she was liable to be good by
fits and starts, and then she "got cranky." Notwithstanding
the fact, they were still friends, nothing more,
and, as Miss Palmer sometimes sighed to herself, "Will
never be anything more."</p>

<p>"You were, I thought," she declared one day, "the
sweetest kind of a boy. But of late you are so concerned
about Y.M.C.A.'s, and libraries, and schools, and the
like, for our people, and how many are being killed and
all that, that I am sometimes serious in my belief that
you are losing your mind."</p>

<p>"I came to show you the article in <i>The Herald</i>, by the
park commissioner, with regard to the establishing of a
park for Negroes. I suppose you have read it? I am
certainly glad to know that you have white people in
your city, who are showing some interest in the civic
welfare of our race; and from what he has suggested,
with regard to this park for our people, to be centrally
located, there is conclusive evidence, that the white
people are coming to appreciate that the evolution of
these black people can be brought about otherwise than
in the chain gang."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please don't today, Mr. Wyeth, please don't," she begged.
"Promise just once that you will try to be, if it's only
for a minute, as you were when I became acquainted
with you. Let's drop this matter about the park and all
that today. These Negroes here would do nothing with
a park but fight in it. And a library, they don't read;
so what's the use." She came to him, and before he
could say a word in protest, she had gotten on the davenport,
and beside him very closely. In that moment,
Miss Palmer felt that she wanted to hear him say something
about her.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, in a voice that was full of feigned
passion. "Do you care for me?" It was so sudden that
he did not know how to accept it, whether as a joke or
serious. He had, of late, been backing up on the flirtation.
However, she was evidently serious, so, with a
jolly word, he talked with her at some length about
nothing. Presently she became meditative. She spoke
of her unhappy life with a sigh, and then fell to accounts
regarding her little boy.</p>

<p>"My entire hope is centered in him. I intend to make
a doctor out of him, and to do that, I will have to work
hard and save money to put him through school when
he is grown up, and you see what that will call for."</p>

<p>He was a lad of ten years, and the image of his mother.
The future of the American Negro was bright in his eyes;
and he assisted commerce to a degree, by consuming as
much coca cola as he could buy, with as many nickels as
he could gather; likewise, peanuts, crackerjack and
candies.</p>

<p>"He's <i>some</i> boy," glowed Wyeth, enthusiastically.
"I wish I possessed a lad like him. I would feel proud."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to have something to do with
him?" she said, and he replied jokingly:</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>She nestled close, very close. So close that he felt her
hot breath upon his cheek. "You do care for me a
little, don't you?" she almost implored. He was embarrassed,
but replied:</p>

<p>"Of course, I <i>like</i> you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"I love you," she said. "I love you," she said again.</p>

<p>"Ooh, mamma!" cried her son, at that moment.
"Come and see the funny man coming down the street.
Ooh, but he is so funny!" She moved away guiltily.
A moment later, he arose and took his leave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ump-um-um! Man, you done bring dat book heah

<p>"Oh, but you're a good joker," he laughed, depreciatingly.
"You drew four or five great big dollars Saturday

as you said you would, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yesser, yesser, ah knows ah said I would; but sumpin'

did'n' have 'nough 'n' had t' borra frum ma whi' people."</p>

<p>"That's too bad indeed," said Wyeth. Sometimes he
said this freely, and again, his voice carried a touch of
disappointment and impatience, because, sometimes he
met a half dozen such instances, when he went to deliver
on Monday. As a rule, and since he was by now accustomed
to it, he offered sympathy to the unfortunate
wife who had to pay so many fines, and went his way.</p>

<p>"Yeh. 'Es allus gittin' in sumpin'. Las' yeah&mdash;ah

she bustled about her duties, with a determined set of
the head.</p>

<p>"How did he come to get locked up this time?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! Yes, yes. It's lak dis&mdash;so 'e said. 'E was

<p>And thus it went. Wyeth found the women, in a great
measure, trying to do right, as they so regarded it. But
the men, from the saloon to a tiger, thoroughly soaked
themselves, regardless of the cost, so long as they had it.
And then, to a crap game, where they lost the remainder.
Evidently there must have been some winning; but
Wyeth never happened to find the winner. They were
all losers. If he had their orders and expected to deliver
the book, he had to plan to deliver the same on Saturday
night, and before they found the enticing game.
And for telling the truth, they drew the line on that&mdash;refused
to have anything to do whatever with keeping
their word. When he ran into a man who was as good
as his word, and which he did occasionally, he was so
surprised that he became nervous. Many of the white
agents and collectors informed him, that, with a few
exceptions, they drew the line on any credit business
with the men, because they simply could not trust them.
Of course this was not among the so-called "best" people;
but with them, he had a hard time securing an order,
since, to make appearance was their obvious effort, in a
large measure. When the cook advised him to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
butler, he forthwith inquired whether he gambled or
drank; for, if so, he thanked her for her kindness, and
made no effort to get the order, for it was useless, in
four cases out of five.</p>

<p>Hence it came to pass, that Sidney Wyeth learned
that his people were the victims of liquor and gaming, and
this was the result of ill training, ignorance, and lack of
civic observation. If John Barleycorn was at the bottom
of most of the crime&mdash;which grew, in most instances, out
of discussions and differences of opinion regarding trifling
matters&mdash;ignorance was at the bottom of the indulgence.</p>

<p>On this day, when he had completed his work, he
stopped at the library. This was not open to colored
people, which he knew; but, since what he desired could
not be obtained elsewhere, he decided to go to the desk
and make known the fact, and leave it to the civil regard
of the librarian. He was ushered into a room to one
side, which was not always used, and they brought anything
to him that he wished. When he took his leave,
he was invited to call at any time, and he could expect
the same accommodations.</p>

<p>Some time later he did, and while looking through the
matter which was the occasion of his visit, the librarian
approached him, and said:</p>

<p>"You will perhaps be interested in hearing that it is
the desire of the board, to take some steps toward a
library for the colored people of the city."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he replied. "I am sure I am interested.
Nothing, I assure you, is much more needed."</p>

<p>"Yes," the other went on earnestly. "It has been
the desire of the board to do so for some time; but,
owing to the fact, I regret to say, that&mdash;well, those in
your race whom we have waited for, and looked to, to
take some initiative with regard to the matter, have not
appeared to care much&mdash;well, not any, as yet." He
paused a moment, while Wyeth waited.</p>

<p>"I presume," said he presently, "that you are one of
the professors."</p>

<p>"No, I am not. I am not connected with any school,
in fact, I am not connected with anything here, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
than a book, of which I am the author, and which is
being circulated by myself here in the city. But I am
deeply interested in anything pertaining to what you
mention."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said the other, and disappointment was
evident in his tone. "I had hoped, from the interest you
show in literature, that you are connected with one of
the schools. But I will state what we have planned on,
and what would be necessary on the part of your people,
in order to stimulate such a movement.</p>

<p>"This city is, of course, unable to make such an investment;
but it, the board, is willing to cooperate with
the leaders of your people, the teachers and preachers, in
bringing this to the attention of northern philanthropists,
and, with a little effort concentrated on the issue, it is
reasonable to suppose that, in view of libraries given to
the different colored schools in the south, the securing of
one here is quite possible."</p>

<p>"That is the way I have been compelled to see it,
through knowledge gained in observation," Wyeth
agreed.</p>

<p>"Oh, it can be obtained, it should be obtained." He
paused again hesitantly, then went on, somewhat determinedly:
"This city has a dreadful record for crime;
and, while I regret to make the mention, yet, I think
you will agree with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the great amount of the crime is among the
black population," Wyeth assisted, unembarrassed.</p>

<p>"Exactly. It is a dreadful affair, this daily murdering
of human beings, and this continual herding to the chain
gang. These people go there and get in so much trouble,
because their minds are untrained&mdash;and this is due to
their environment, which is bad. It is a distressing condition
which the state is facing. A library will, in time,
have a marked effect upon existing conditions. There is
no park either, in fact, there is nothing but the open
street, the schools and churches for the colored youth;
whereas, the white children have everything to help
them become the proper men and women. And yet, and
here is where it becomes awkward for the public to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
anything. You are aware that the south is poor, and,
therefore, unable to give even their white population
what the north can in regard to uplift; but, as I remarked,
the leaders appear to show such little interest
in betterment.</p>

<p>"Now, for instance, if the teachers and preachers
would unite themselves into a body, for the purpose of
securing a library for the colored people of Effingham,
and persist in this matter, eventually they would have a
building, and not less than fifty thousand volumes. But,
as it now stands, rarely do any of them call in the manner
you do. And, before anything can be done by the board,
it is expedient on the part of these people, to get some
public sentiment, in favor of the proposal. Now, what
is your opinion of it?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I cannot be otherwise than heartily in
accordance with such a proposition. And, I regret to
agree with you, that the people we, or you, look to as
our leaders, show little interest in this matter. Publicity
is necessary. I could, for instance, write an article
calling attention to such a movement, and have it published
in the colored paper; but they would not read it
with other than a passing interest in such a sheet. I
have had it in view for some time past of doing something&mdash;or,
I should say, saying something. I shall not
yet, however, state just what or how I will say it; but
suffice that I am going to say something, and say it at a
time and in such words, that the Negro public, as well
as the whites, will, I hope, sit up and take notice."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that. Drop in at any time, and if
we can help you in any way, we will be only too glad to
do so," said the librarian, enthusiastically, and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>When Wyeth got to his room, he thought long and
deeply upon the subject. And when he retired that
evening, he had begun the formulation of a plan that
would wake up this sluggish resignation, which seemed
to possess the race to whom the white people looked to
for initiative.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, when he received his paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<i>The Herald</i>, an article spread over the front page, double
column, caught his attention, and he read it through, as
no doubt every one did, who was interested in civic welfare.
It was another by the park commissioner, and was
in regard to a park to be centrally located, and to be
used exclusively for the use of the colored population of
the city.</p>

<p>In Effingham, there are perhaps a half dozen small
and large parks, and all for white use exclusively. During
the hot days of the long summer, black people must
roast in their stuffy little homes, perhaps a fourth of which
face alleys. Black children have no place to play, no
place to exercise their little bodies, or give free vent to
their desire for child play. Crime, therefore, is their
greatest environment.</p>

<p>Stealing is so bad in this city, that the druggist remarked
to Wyeth one day, that if he should awaken at two A.M.
and see a Negro pushing a box car up the street, not to
become excited or even be surprised. Since he had been
in Effingham, a man who lived to the rear of his abode,
and who owned a horse and wagon, had, on three different
occasions, and in less than two months, found it in a
remote part of the city. It was tied to a tree or a fence,
or maybe not tied at all. It was nothing uncommon.
The horse was used to haul stuff that had previously
been spotted and later stolen. It is this that the colored
children see and become acquainted with in their alley
homes, and which makes criminals of so many long
before they are of age.</p>

<p>The article by the park commissioner dealt with these
conditions, as well as with the great amount of murder
committed in the city. It was the desire, to locate a
park near the heart of the city, so that these little children
with the ebony faces, might find some relief from
their alley homes, and in that way, help a little toward
the discouragement of so much crime. The jail was
overrun with both women and men prisoners; the funds
for the purpose of building a larger jail was not forthcoming,
so the city could do the least by giving these
people some place of recreation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>However, went on the commissioner's article, neither
the city nor the commissioner could be expected to make
any move toward giving this to the colored people, until
the colored people themselves, through their leaders, the
preachers and teachers, of which there was estimated to
be in the neighborhood of three hundred, would show, in
some manner, that they desired it. To purchase the
ground and remove the buildings thereon, prepare and
dress it down to a park, would, of course, require a considerable
outlay of capital. The commissioner, therefore,
would be glad to consult with this body of people with a
view to that end. If it was not convenient for all to
come, he added, kindly write him their views and desires
with regard to the matter. But the commissioners would
consider it more demonstrative, if the teachers and
preachers of the city, colored, would call upon him in
person; and, in conclusion, he set a day, and requested
that as many, if not all of them, would call at his office
on the afternoon of the following Wednesday.</p>

<p>Wyeth spoke of the matter to those he knew; few
though, had concerned themselves as much as to read it
even; while others made idle remarks, and so the day
came.</p>

<p>Yes, it came, and to the office went, to be exact, five
teachers and three preachers out of a possible total
number of three hundred. The commissioner was too
discouraged to keep these precious eight very long, so,
with a few words, announcement was made that a pasture,
five miles from town, could be leased for a small figure,
and that a car line went within a mile of it; so that it
was moved and seconded, and the colored people got a
park.</p>

<p>The following day, the papers were considerate enough
to make small mention of it, and that was the end of the
matter.</p>

<p>When Sidney Wyeth had learned the details, he decided
upon a plan which will be unfolded in a later chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>This Man Is Losing His Mind</i>"</p>


<p>"Hello, stranger," said Miss Palmer one beautiful
morning, when he came strolling by. "I haven't seen
you for a long time," she said, smiling not overly pleasant.
In fact, Miss Palmer looked worn, and acted likewise.
She did not present a hopeful example, as Wyeth saw her
now. She was sweeping the sidewalk in front of her
place with a broom that was worn to the last threads,
and more. These had been cut, and only the small wire
held it to the handle.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed, upon looking at it.
"What do you call that?" and pointed at it with a
laugh. She looked sad and replied:</p>

<p>"That's my broom. Isn't it a shame? But it's all
the broom I have. Won't you buy me one, and give it to
me as a present? You make plenty of money, and I
have five fifty in the house for you myself." She smiled up
into his face now wearily, and he was touched. He was,
moreover, sorry now for what he had said. But to make
amends, he replied cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Sure, sis. Take any part of what is due me, and use
it for that purpose."</p>

<p>"That is so sweet of you," she smiled, gratefully. "I
always believed you were sweet, regardless of the fact
that of late you have become so awful."</p>

<p>"How's that?" he inquired, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have been constrained to believe you are losing
your mind. You have succeeded in criticising about
everybody and everything, that pertains to the good
colored people of this city."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Palmer," he cried, looking hurt, "I have not
criticised everybody and everything. I have only shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
that I think a lot of the so-called good people are four-flushers
and selfish creatures, with no real love for the
race, nor any regard for the civic improvement of these
black people. But I know lots of good, kind, sincere
colored people in this town, that I am proud of as members
of the race."</p>

<p>"Come into the house," she invited, and presently
they were seated in the parlor. At once Miss Palmer
took up the discussion of society, and the buying of
homes, which had reached a degree of impracticability
among the colored people, notwithstanding the sound
idea.</p>

<p>All over the country, during this pilgrimage, Wyeth had
witnessed this purchase idea with a mark of encouragement.
And, to say that they were succeeding, was a fact
that meant a great deal to their future welfare.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer delighted always to discuss the buying
of a home, and marrying. Another teacher was visiting
her that day, and likewise shared her views. Wyeth
did too, but he always had questions to ask, that sometimes
made the discussion rather upset.</p>

<p>Now he read the Negro paper, and had fearfully observed
that an unusual and alarming amount of foreclosures
was the order. In conversation with the numerous
real estate dealers, he learned, moreover, that many
of the attempts at purchasing, were foredoomed to
failure when made; that to own a home, in a great
many cases had become a fetish, and was, therefore, not
based upon a practical consideration in the beginning.</p>

<p>A very successful dealer, colored, had told him confidentially,
that he sold many homes, and would have
bet, if it had been expedient, that they would not be
able to keep the payments up for a year.</p>

<p>"How does so much of this come about?" he had
inquired.</p>

<p>"Notoriety. Too many people do not study, although
they may have a liberal school training among our
people. It's the great ambition of too many, to get into
a home with the first object of being seen therein, to
show to their friends and put on airs. They buy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
no idea whatever as to value, liability or anything.
They have simply stinted themselves until they have
managed to save a few dollars, and desire to get into the
biggest home possible, to be where they can be seen by
their friends."</p>

<p>"The rate of interest appears to be very high, I have
observed," said he, by way of comment. The other
looked at him meaningly, and then said:</p>

<p>"Interest eats these people alive here; just sucks their
life's blood&mdash;but it is not that alone. Not one in five
knows how to arrange a loan. They permit themselves
to be governed by some dealer, who, in almost every
instant, is the worst grafter possible. They will make a
loan with a life of three years, at eight per cent interest,
and five per cent commission. Now you know that no
loan running three years, on property that poor people
are trying to buy on the installment plan, is practical.
Yet that is the kind of loan that most of these cheap
sharks offer to the masses of our people, who have no
judgment. A Negro is unable, as a rule, to realize that
three years is a very short time. He is compelled to
learn by bitter experience. The worst feature of this is,
that at the end of it, he is so discouraged, that often he
does not benefit by this experience, because the failure
has gotten his heart, and he is done for.</p>

<p>"At the end of three years, which seems like three days
when they are trying to buy a home, the shark is around
for a renewal of the mortgage, and must, therefore,
collect another cash commission of five per cent. Think
of it! In two-thirds of such instances, it takes every
dime they have paid in those three years. Sometimes
more. Now how can people pay for a home under such
conditions! But there is another side of it. And it all
comes from the inability of our people to see further
than their noses.</p>

<p>"Almost all these purchases are made beyond the
extension of the sewerage, often the water works, positively
no street improvements, and side walks are rare;
but, in three years, in order to boom the property, the
promoter is active in bringing some of these improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ments
within reach of this property. That adds about
one-half to two-thirds more to the cost of the property
he is trying to buy. Moreover, when these people know
anything, they will not buy a house built by these promoters,
for it is nothing but the cheapest shell they can
get to stand, but attractive from the outside. In two
years, the occupant is fortunate if he doesn't have to
build another.</p>

<p>"Then comes the great day. These people cannot pay
that commission over again, and the loan company
doesn't care to increase the loan, maybe, by including
the commission in a new one. If they are unable to
make arrangements with a bank, and that means they
are going to deed them the property, seven cases in ten,
foreclosure proceedings are instituted. The property is
finally deeded by the sheriff to the mortgagee. Now
here is another phase: This piece of property can then
be sold quicker than before, for this reason: It is very
easy to frame up a tale, to the effect that a party who
was purchasing the place was a shiftless drunkard, or
anything, and imagination can supply the rest; but,
inasmuch as they had taken the property back, they are
now offering it at a greatly reduced price and better
terms. There are so many subtle ways of drawing people
in, that it would take a volume to relate them all; but
they come to the same in the end. Installment property
at two thousand dollars can be bought for about twelve
to not exceed fifteen hundred. Instead of commission
and everything else, buying by the installment plan in
this, and every overboomed southern town, costs from
twice to three times what the property would actually
cost, if the purchaser could pay half of the purchase
price cash, for, in that way he could secure terms, and
could pay interest rate on the remainder. In time he
would get the same paid, and have his little home."</p>

<p>"And that, you feel, is the reason for all this foreclosure?"
said Wyeth.</p>

<p>"That is the <i>cause</i> of it. Why, advertising property
for foreclosure has become a feature of competition,
between the three Negro papers in this town. They get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
more money out of that end, than they do from the advertisements
through straight business, for the purpose
of selling it originally."</p>

<p>"It would seem that the people would get on to such
methods by and by," Wyeth commented.</p>

<p>"Some, of course, do, and avoid it; but you cannot
imagine how many do not. It all comes about through
a lack of general intelligence. Too many of our people
do not read anything; are, therefore, without any vision
or judgment of their own. They don't know. And, of
course, are made the goats of those who do."</p>

<p>"So that explains why a portion of this town to the
west, and which is occupied almost exclusively by our
people, has such dreadful streets and no sidewalks whatever."</p>

<p>"That's it. They will, perhaps, have none for the next
twenty-five years. Too much property is being bought,
and so little is being paid for, that it is a continual change
about."</p>

<p>"I find a great many of the people&mdash;intelligent people&mdash;who
do not care to see this side of it," Wyeth remarked.</p>

<p>"Half of the school teachers, for instance, seem to wish
not to see it. And they get stung! But they are so
anxious to be seen, and to be referred to in a position
beyond their means, no wonder."</p>

<p>So Sidney Wyeth had to take this man's point of view
for more than one reason. Like Attalia&mdash;but worse,
these people considered literature, as a whole, dead
stock. More than sixty thousand in number, the demand
among them for books and magazines, was insufficient to
justify any one's running a place for such a purpose. It
was not large enough to justify either of the Negro drug
stores carrying periodicals in stock, even those that
were carried by all white drug stores, excepting those in
districts occupied and patronized by the colored people.
And with all this, there was not the least claim for that
kind of knowledge. More than a hundred churches never
encouraged the people to read anything but the Bible:
apparently, the obtaining of a library had not worried
any but Sidney Wyeth; it has been seen how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
worried over the securing of a park. Is it a wonder,
with all this under his observation, that Sidney Wyeth,
who came from a land where people read and thought,
and had some perspective, eventually came to be regarded
as a chronic critic? He had witnessed more murders than
he had in all the days of his life.</p>

<p>Having digressed to such a length, we will return now
to Miss Annie Palmer, who was possessed with the ambition
to be established in a home of her own, and to be
seen by those who knew her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Just think of it, suga'," she said to the other teacher.
"You can get the nicest kind of a home in the west end
for a moderate sum, and only fifty or a hundred dollars
down on the best of them. The rest is paid just like you
pay rent, and no more." It was this, Wyeth recalled,
that got them. "It cost no more than to pay rent after
the first payment."</p>

<p>"Um-um," from the other.</p>

<p>"And the sewers, and sidewalks, and streets and lights
are all there," said Wyeth kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you go for an argument," Miss Palmer
retorted, angrily. Wyeth grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, these things have all been completed to include
this property...."</p>

<p>Miss Palmer said nothing to him in reply.</p>

<p>"And you can get it after the first payment like paying
rent," commented the other teacher.</p>

<p>"Um-m," let out Miss Palmer, sweetly.</p>

<p>"What sweet real estate dealer offers such bargains
and <i>easy</i> things?" said Wyeth, humorously. The druggist,
who knew everybody's business, had told him that
Miss Palmer, at one time, was the object of every real
estate shark in Effingham. And then some one lodged
her in the suburbs, and since, she had been left alone.
So he wondered whether it was because Miss Palmer, as
a lady high in colored society, could not conveniently get
such an amount together.</p>

<p>"This man is losing his mind," she said, to the other
teacher. The other now regarded Wyeth dubiously.
He grinned and then said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you start buying, or biting on one of these <i>easy</i>
homes in the west end that you refer to, you are going
to lose your head."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so," Miss Palmer essayed, with much
spirit. "Do you suppose, that with me teaching in the
schools of this city for thirteen years&mdash;" and she had
begun at twenty-two, so she told him once&mdash;"I do not
know something! And if you infer that I haven't a
hundred dollars, then you haven't become acquainted
with Annie Palmer! Don't you worry about her, for she
always has a roll convenient. And you never see any
collectors coming here, and leaving without what they
came for." She was very dignified now, as she went to
the door to answer a knock.</p>

<p>The room in which they sat opened into a small hallway,
which was entered from the street by a glass door.
It was at this open door, that a man stood, who, however,
could not be seen from where Miss Palmer's company sat.
He could be heard, though. And they, the company,
couldn't help hearing. They were not eavesdropping. It
was then that Wyeth learned Miss Palmer was vain.
He could not help recalling, that if "no collectors went
away without what they came for," it was because they
expected nothing when they came. So, when Miss
Palmer had completed her trite sentence and sallied forth
to answer the knock, they could not help hearing her
say very quickly, and with some embarrassment:</p>

<p>"Oh, you are too early. Come back tomorrow. I
have my books to deliver this afternoon, and will be
ready for you tomorrow, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>That was as far as she got. And her company could
not be censured for overhearing the rest of it, that is,
what the other made in reply. The chances are the
other was not aware of their presence, a few feet away,
but that is a matter for conjecture. Miss Palmer could
be heard attempting to finish with him, without his words
that came in a flow. She was nervous, but he would
have his say, and so he said, cutting off her discourse:</p>

<p>"I'm tired of this stalling, all this stalling you have
been handing us for months. This has got to come to
an end."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll bring it to the office, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind, and you know you
won't!"</p>

<p>"I'll pay you tomorrow, sure, sure, sure!" Why
didn't the man be a gentleman and go, go, go! Plainly
Miss Palmer was dreadfully nervous, more, as she could
be heard by those who were listening. She was plainly
in agony. The collector was on the warpath, and went
on relentlessly:</p>

<p>"If you haven't made some disposition of it by Monday
a week, get that stuff ready for the wagon," and a moment
later his steps died away in the distance.</p>

<p>For one moment, Wyeth saw the face of her friend,
but he couldn't believe it! And still, when Miss Palmer
returned and resumed her discussion with regard to buying
homes, he would have sworn that the other had to
smother very quickly a gleeful expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

what's the matter with you today? Are you drunk?
Pull that train forward and back it up as I tell you, or I

<p>"Oh, Sam," called some one.</p>

<p>"Aw, don't bother me today. I'm in a hurry. I am
called by the board of directors to talk over the purchase
of the A.G.S. I am chairman of the committee, and
have no time to talk with you."</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam," greeted Wyeth, as this worthy came
hurriedly by. Sam halted a moment and gazed at him,
then walked forward and extended his hand, crying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Morgan. I'm glad to see you. I am called by
the directors of the Southern Railway, with regard to
purchasing that line and merging it with the L. &amp; N."</p>

<p>"I see. Who owns the L. &amp; N. now," he inquired,
casually.</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"And the A.G.S.?"</p>

<p>"I only have a half interest in that now."</p>

<p>"I understand that you refused to buy out the controlling
interest in the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company."</p>

<p>"Yes, I refused. I don't like the line-up in the directorship.
And, besides, I cannot see my way clear to act as
chairman of the board of control, therefore, I considered
it unwise to invest any millions in the thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't detain you, since I know you are so

<p>"Engineer, if you don't switch better, call at the office
this evening and get your time. I will fire you," and
Sam hurried to his office, just as John Moore came from
another direction, sleepy-eyed, and looking like the "last
rose of summer". The Mis' was waiting for him, and
as soon as he was inside, she inquired with concealed
suspicion:</p>

<p>"Well, where were you last night?"</p>

<p>"In jail."</p>

<p>"You seem fond of that place of late."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders sleepily.</p>

<p>"Where did they get you this time?"</p>

<p>"Rosie's."</p>

<p>"You've been quite a frequenter about there of

<p>"That's mah business. Don't try t' hand me no

<p>"Didn't you have breakfast up there; but then it
seems you left before breakfast? How came you back

<p>"How did you know that I had been got? You are
too smart nowaday's anyhow."</p>

<p>"Who went your bond?"</p>

<p>He regarded her out of impatient eyes now. He
glared at her, but said: "I was eight dollars winner, and
had two dollars besides."</p>

<p>"Um-m. So you give that to a professional bondsman."</p>

<p>"Hello," came a call from the outside.</p>

<p>"Hello," called back the Mis'. "Come in."</p>

<p>"Is John Moore here?" said a bad looking Negro, with
a head like a monkey and no chin at all. Moore looked
uneasy.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are," said the other, as he spied Moore.
His tone was full of contempt, and a touch of anger was
mingled. "Where is my part for the stuff you disposed
of?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ssh! Not so loud."</p>

<p>"Not so the devil! You can't shoo me away any
longer. You ain't paid me for the last bunch a chicken
I brung heah; and now you want t' shoo me away on
this last stuff we done stole togedder."</p>

<p>"Will you hush. We'll talk this matter over outside."</p>

<p>"We's go'n talk it over heah, 'n' you go'n hand me
ove fo' dollah's, ah I'm go'in' t' take it outta yo' stinkin'
hide!" He looked at Moore now with an evil eye, and
that worthy backed up and picked up a pair of scissors,
that he had brought in late one night from one of the
mysterious directions.</p>

<p>"Oh, you go'n push them things through me, eh!
All right, ole nigga. This is wha you 'n' me mixes it.
I gi'n fix you ah you gi'n fix me," and with that he
started in the other's direction.</p>

<p>"Now, Sha'p Head. Ain' I done always treated you
right?" Moore whimpered.</p>

<p>"Naw, naw! 'n that's what I'm gi'n land on you

<p>"Now just name a time when I ain'," Moore temporized,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Naw, I say. Git out that winda 'f you don't wanta

make you run some. Don't you b'lieve I'm go'n run yu?"</p>

<p>"'C'ose I b'lieve you. I b'lieve you go'n come in heah
'n' run me outta ma house, outta ma house," cried
Moore, piteously.</p>

<p>"Come pickin' up a pair a-scissors two feet long to
push in me," roared the other. "I got a notion t' run
yu ontell yo' ankles gits hot. I'll run yu six blocks, you
lop eared bull dog!"</p>

<p>"You outta be 'shamed t' treat me that way, Sha'p

<p>"Come outside, John Moore, 'n' leave yo' coat inside.

<p>"All right, Sha'p Head. 'F you jes' gotta run me
outta ma house, then go on outside. I'm a-comin."</p>

<p>The other came through the room where Wyeth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Legs were trying to play a game of checkers. He was
puffing so hard, that he appeared to be afraid of himself.
"That low down skunk! I'm go'n run that nigga ontell
'is ankle's done be so hot that the streets go'n melt
behind him! Doggone 'im!"</p>

<p>"Are you outside, Sha'p Head?" called Moore, nervously.</p>

<p>"I'm out heah, you liver eater. Come out wi' yo
ankle's greased, 'cause you go'n run six blocks faster yu
ebber did in yo' life; 'n' when you gits to d' end of it,
I' gi'n kill yu!"</p>

<p>"Bang!" went the door, and the key turned. To
describe the indignation of Moore for the next few
minutes; what he would do; what he ought to have
done, would be beyond the possibilities of our pen. He
was positively so bad that he had much effort to keep
from doing injury to himself. Legs winked at Wyeth,
and then, rising, unlocked the door and slipped out
quietly. A moment later, a terrible banging was instituted
upon the door. Wyeth held it closed, with a
great feigned effort.</p>

<p>"Let me at him! Let me at him!" cried Legs from
the outside, but John Moore didn't wait to hear any
more. A crash and a rattle as of falling glass scattered
about, showed that an exit was unconventionally made
in the rear. Wyeth and Legs came around in time to see
him going over the back fence. The next time they saw
him, he was leading the other by about two rods, as
they went up the street.</p>

<p>"Jumped right into his jaws," laughed Glenview, as
they watched the chase from the porch.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, some one tore into the house, and
turned the key of the door so quickly, that it seemed like
an automatic spring lock.</p>

<p>It was John Moore.</p>

<p>"Let's go down to the drug store," suggested Wyeth.
Legs didn't hang out in that direction, so Glenview was
the recipient of the suggestion. He couldn't, so, presently,
Wyeth went alone.</p>

<p>"They are going to fall down in both those towns, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the securing of a Y.M.C.A. for Negroes, and I knew
they would when they started," the druggist was saying,
when Wyeth entered.</p>

<p>"Negroes can secure nothing but churches down south,"
commented another.</p>

<p>"They have only a few weeks left, before the time
limit on the appropriations from the Jew expires. He
offered twenty-five thousand to any association where the
people secured an additional seventy-five thousand.
Now six months after the campaign for the association in
Grantville," so said a mail clerk who ran to that city,
"less than five thousand in cash, out of a total of more
than thirty-three thousand dollars subscribed, has been
collected to date. How can this&mdash;what is the name of
the secretary of the proposed association&mdash;yes, I
have it, Jacobs&mdash;Rev. Wilson Jacobs, figure they will be
able to secure one in that town?"</p>

<p>"It's all stuff. Nigga's down here would do nothing
with an association no way," said the druggist.</p>

<p>"I stopped at the Y.M.C.A. when I was in Chicago
this summer," said the bookkeeper in the Dime Savings
Bank. "It appears to be conducted with great success,
and is surely a fine, clean, up-to-date place to stop,
regardless of the fact that almost everything is open to
Negroes in that city."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the Negroes in Chicago are civilized," said
another. "These Negroes down here would have to have
a half dozen police standing around to keep order, if they
had one."</p>

<p>"But don't you feel such a thing in this town would act
as a great moral benefit?" suggested Wyeth, at this
juncture.</p>

<p>"We now hear from Tempest," smiled the druggist.
He had not been able, as yet, to reconcile himself to the
bet he lost some months before, and had since a grudge
against Wyeth.</p>

<p>"I see by today's paper, that Wilson Jacobs will
address the people of the city in regard to the Christian
forward movement, and will be assisted by several white
men of high standing in the city."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, speeches will be all right; but I'd bet a dollar
to a dime that they will never secure a Y.M.C.A. in
the town he represents. As for Effingham, no chance."</p>

<p>"You seem to be successful in getting the biggest kind
of churches here," said Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the druggist, "and they will be paying
for them, as they have been for the last&mdash;since I ever
knew anything."</p>

<p>"But they have the churches, nevertheless."</p>

<p>"Oh, so far as that goes, yes."</p>

<p>"They must have had to pay as much as forty per cent
of the cost, to secure a loan for the remainder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tempest; but what has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if the big church on the corner up the street
could be secured at a cost of seventy-five thousand
dollars, half or more of which I understand has been
paid, then, a like amount should be available in a town
of this size, and which has an equal number of colored
people, shouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Tempest is out for argument," said the druggist.</p>

<p>"No argument, when almost every large city in the
north&mdash;and some not as large as this town&mdash;have a
Y.M.C.A. for its black population. And more than
half that have such, have not nearly the colored population
that this town has, and positively have not nearly
the need."</p>

<p>"Tempest has been worrying about a library, a park,
and everything else for this town, in the months he has
been here," the druggist said, looking almost amused.
Wyeth took exception.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> interested in this town, and in another, where I
see and read of more crime and murder, than I ever
dreamed was possible."</p>

<p>"Then, Tempest," said the druggist, naively, "you
ought to get one. Or, at least, you ought to awaken, by
some initiative on your part, some enthusiasm to that
end. You see all we need, you do, a globe trotter, and
you have certainly criticised to that end, and now," his
voice took on a cold, hard tone, "I say: Do something
to prove this criticism worth the while, or I'll brand <i>you</i>
as a faker&mdash;a frost, with all your premeditated ideas!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one about was silent, while their eyes turned
and regarded Sidney Wyeth. About the corners of their
mouths a smile that spelled of a sneer, played subtly.
If Sidney Wyeth didn't see it, he at least felt it. And in
that moment, he realized that he would not dare show
his face about this place, lest he be scorned henceforth,
if he didn't take the stand the druggist had taken.</p>

<p>"Very well, Dr. Randall," he said, rising. "<i>I shall do
so.</i>" He regarded them all for a moment, with a firm
sweep of his eyes, and, next, he turned and left the store.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TWENTY-FOUR_2" id="CHAPTER_TWENTY-FOUR_2"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Arraignment</i></p>


<p>"I guess that will do," whispered Wyeth to himself,
arising from his typewriter at one-thirty the following
morning. Carefully he placed the typewritten pages in
the drawer, and retired.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"A colored man to see you, Mr. Byron," said the clerk,
to the managing editor of the Effingham <i>Age-Herald</i>.</p>

<p>"Show him in," said the other shortly, and kept about
his work. A moment later, Sidney Wyeth stood before
the editor.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I should like twenty minutes talk with you, Mr.
Byron," said the other calmly.</p>

<p>The editor laid down his pen, and raising his eyes, he
began at the feet, which were somewhat large, ran the gaze
up a pair of long legs, and finally saw a chin, a nose and
the eyes, and there they stopped. He had been in the
act of freezing, what he was confident was a crank, a
fool, or a knave. To walk calmly into the office of the
managing editor, and ask for twenty minutes of his time!
It was incredulous. And yet, when he saw the eyes of
the other, something therein told him strangely, that this
man was no fool, nor a knave&mdash;nor any of the things he
had been feeling. He was&mdash;well, he was a colored man,
which made it stranger still, for colored men had not
been in the habit of coming to his office at all, much less
asking for such an amount of time on his busy day. He
shifted his position, and finally, after swallowing guiltily,
the words he started to say, he added:</p>

<p>"Be seated."</p>

<p>"I realize that you are busy, very busy, Mr. Byron,"
Wyeth began rapidly, not waiting for the other to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
anything more. "But my business is a matter of grave
importance, of the very gravest importance. And that
is why I have called, and asked for the amount of time
which I am aware is not customary for you to grant."</p>

<p>The other said nothing. He knew of nothing to say;
but, somehow, he simply sat viewing Sidney Wyeth out
of curious eyes&mdash;and waiting. The other unfolded one
of several papers; they were, the editor now saw, previous
issues of his paper. He wondered. He had been
very careful to kill stories that smelled of strife between
the races.... He did not conduct his paper with an
appeal to race prejudice. Mr. Byron was proud of the
fact, too. Moreover, while he had doubts as to the
hurried evolution of the Negro race to a place in the
least equal to the one of which he was a member, he
had always tried, when he could conveniently do so, to
say a word of kind encouragement with regard to the
colored people. Only that week, he had run a strong
account on the front page, with regard to the governor's
visit to Tuscola, at the invitation of its principal, who
had extended it. The invitation came for the purpose
of allowing the state government to see, by a personal
inspection, whether the colored schools were entitled to
a portion of certain funds, the Federal government had
appropriated for the purpose of farm demonstration work.
Following his return to the city, the governor had, without
reservation, announced that the appropriation would
be so divided, as to allow Tuscola Institute and another
Negro school, a liberal portion of said funds.</p>

<p>Steven Byron justly took some of the credit for this,
and now is it a wonder that he held his breath, while this
young Negro, whom he had never seen before, unfolded
the paper and finally began.</p>

<p>Coming to the side of his desk, Wyeth reseated himself,
and, pointing to an article, said: "You recall this
incident?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the editor, still wondering.</p>

<p>"And this one also," said the other, with another paper
unfolded and spread before him.</p>

<p>"Of course."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>And for the next few seconds he showed him others.
The other was still wondering, when Wyeth said:</p>

<p>"Do you recall following this particular Wednesday,
when you published this article in regard to the
park for colored people, the number of teachers and
preachers who presented themselves as the commissioner
had suggested and requested?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. There were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eight, to be exact. Three preachers and five teachers."</p>

<p>"Yes." The other was still curious.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what number of preachers and
teachers you have among the colored people of this
city?"</p>

<p>"Why, a great many, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Three hundred or more, according to the directory.
I don't think they got all that teach elsewhere, and make
their homes here during vacation; and I know they
have not all the preachers, but that is neither here nor
there.</p>

<p>"In regard to this article about securing a library for
the colored people. How many visits, can you recall,
were paid you by any of the teachers and preachers
following the publication of it? And can you recall how
many letters you received, or anything else connected
with the instant?"</p>

<p>"I can quite well, I regret to say," replied the editor;
"for the simple reason I received no letters nor any
visits."</p>

<p>"You requested, in your paper of recent issue, and
which is before you, that the leading colored people&mdash;and
of course this includes the teachers&mdash;should call at your
office to make arrangement for the coming lecture in
regard to the need of Y.M.C.A.'s for the colored people
of the south. I suppose you have been favored with
many visits?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head sadly, as he replied: "No
one has called among your people."</p>

<p>"Very well. Has it ever occurred to you, Mr. Byron,
that an unusual amount of crime appears to be the
order in this city?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who couldn't realize it, that lived here or knew of
the place through the columns of the papers?"</p>

<p>"And, unfortunately, eighty per cent of the murders
are committed by a certain two-fifths of our population.
That two-fifths represents my race."</p>

<p>The editor nodded.</p>

<p>"Then, in view of what I have just called to your
attention, does it occur to you that the leaders&mdash;or the
should-be-leaders of my people of this city, are indicating,
by their actions, that they care a hang what becomes of
the race?"</p>

<p>The elements were beginning to clear now. The
editor said: "It certainly doesn't appear so."</p>

<p>"And yet how many of these people, in conversation,
are ever ready, when there is a mob demonstration, to
exploit&mdash;which in itself is much in order&mdash;the 'best'
people. And what consideration should be shown them,
regardless of the ignorance and crime of the masses?
Does it not occur to the casual observer, that a great
deal of negligence is the order when it comes to moral
uplift, on the part of the leading Negroes themselves?"</p>

<p>"I cannot help but agree with you."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Byron, I have prepared an article arraigning
this element of my race, that I have brought with
me, and ask you to examine it, with a view to publication.
I beg you to read the same carefully, and if you feel you
would like to run it, I shall appreciate it. And if you do
not, I will call tomorrow and get the same." Forthwith,
he handed the editor the typewritten pages he had
prepared the night before, and, with a bow, left the
office.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The colored man that was here yesterday, Mr. Byron,
has called again, and waits outside."</p>

<p>"Show him in, show him in at once," cried the editor,
turning about, and preparing himself for a conversation.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Wyeth, after greetings had been
exchanged, "you, of course, realize what I am here for."</p>

<p>"And I am certainly glad you called," returned the
editor, with a serious face. "I have read the article,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and reread parts of it." He paused, and was thoughtful
before he went on, "and must say that it is certainly
strong. Whew! The colored people are liable to lynch
you for such an arraignment, if I know them a little."</p>

<p>"I had considered all that before I submitted it,"
said the other, resignedly.</p>

<p>"If a white man wrote such an article and brought it
to the office, I would not, under any consideration,
publish it. But, since it has been written by a colored
man, well, that makes a difference." He was silent
again.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, regarding Wyeth keenly,
"I thought over what you wrote all last night. I have
thought of it in that way before, but it would never have
done to give utterance to it, me, a white man. But,
take for instance" (he drew out the manuscript, and
turned to a certain page): "You say here, that multitudes
of these so-called leaders have accepted the work
and the teaching of the wizard of Tuscola, merely because
the white people have; and that, in accepting him and
his views for the welfare of the race, it has been merely
to be on the popular side, because the wizard is so much
so; but that they have no sincerity whatever in the
words they say about him." He laid the sheets down,
and, raising his finger, said: "How true that is! Why
I know personally, scores that would kick him for the
statements he has made, if they could do so. But, as
you say further, they seek to get into the band wagon,
at any cost. Now you refer, at some length, to the
proposal to secure a park.</p>

<p>"It is a positive fact, that the good white people of
the south, are made the object of bitterness by the
northern people, on account of something for which they
cannot always be blamed. Now, who would believe at
the north, that the white people were willing and ready
to give the colored people a park, a place for an outing
for the children; and the colored people didn't want
it?" Wyeth shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nobody!" declared the editor. "Nobody in the
world, and yet here is an example in this very town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
which has more murder and crime among its black population
than any city in the world, regardless of the size!
And your race; that body of people, the teachers and
preachers, to whom we have naturally looked and asked
for cooperation in securing a park, have simply ignored
our invitation!</p>

<p>"Now, in regard to the library. Here is the article,
and which I, with care, prepared myself. What good
has it done? I have asked their cooperation, not their
money; but I have been ignored, the same as the
commissioner was in regard to the park. And before
and since then, crime continues.</p>

<p>"We know the law-abiding colored people cannot be
altogether responsible, for the crime of the polluted and
the criminal; but, Lord! One would not suppose that
they would so utterly disregard an effort on our part for
their civic welfare.</p>

<p>"In the end, you call attention to the churches and
the condition of the pastors. It is certainly time someone
is calling to time ignorance in the ministry. Frankly,
I have long been of the opinion you advance in the
article, that an educational requirement should become
a law with regard to preachers, as well as to men in
other professions. Think of it! A profession, calling for
the highest general intelligence, having the lowest rate
of intelligence!</p>

<p>"And, again, this church building bee has submerged
the Baptist church, among the colored people. How
can any of them be of any practical service, when there
is one for every one who can say 'Jesus!'</p>

<p>"You draw attention to the inability of the southern
cities to secure Y.M.C.A's, where the great masses
of black people, of course, live. Not a one is in operation,
as they are conducted by the whites, or by the colored
people of the north. It is easy to excuse the matter by
pleading poverty. But, while that is a plausible excuse,
it seems quite feasible to build great big churches for a
certain few. They have two churches in this town that
would cost more than a Y.M.C.A. building, complete.
And yet, in Grantville, and the other town, and Attalia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
they are required to raise only about one-third of the
amount necessary.</p>

<p>"What, then, is the cause of this failure? You have
answered it in the pages of this manuscript.</p>

<p>"I am going to publish it. And in doing so, I am forewarned
that it is going to arouse a world of indignation
among your people, or I miss my guess. But it needs to
be done. Something should come before them, to awaken
this sluggishness with regard to uplift among their own.
So you may look for it&mdash;the entire article, on the front
page of next Sunday's issue. Good day!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"That was sure a dirty deal Dr. Randall and Dr. Bard
handed Tempest, wasn't it?" remarked L. Jones, editor
and owner of the Effingham <i>Reporter</i>, colored, to his
assistant.</p>

<p>"I don't fully understand. What was it? I hear that
Wyeth bet, or rather, made a bet with Dr. Bard about
something," said the other, attentively.</p>

<p>"Made a bet with Bard and beat him a mile and
Bard, through his friendship with Randall, who has had it
in for Wyeth since he came here, over a bet that Wyeth
won from him, hedged on it the dirtiest you can imagine."</p>

<p>"Tell me in detail about it," requested the other. At
that moment, a private detective entered the office, and,
upon overhearing the conversation, said:</p>

<p>"I can tell you all about it, because I was there when
the bet was made.</p>

<p>"It was like this, or came about in this way: Down
at the drug store, Wyeth has had the nerve&mdash;I guess
that is how you can place it, since the bunch, including
Bard and Randall&mdash;especially Randall, don't appear to
appreciate that any one knows anything but themselves.
At least, they have been this way in regard to that fellow
Wyeth. So an argument came about that Wyeth got
into. He quoted an editorial in regard to the prosperity
of California, and mentioned that California had more
automobiles, in proportion to population, than any state
in the union. Randall had no reason to take exception
to this, further than he was so anxious to put this Wyeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
in the wrong. He started an argument, but, of course,
he had his dose last summer and knew&mdash;if he would have
admitted it&mdash;that Wyeth was not arguing on something
he didn't know. But Bard, who accepts Randall as the
man who knows everything, and who has argued so
much that he would try to down anybody for the sake
of it, was regardless as to the merit. Bard took exception.
Those fellows cannot appreciate anybody's knowing
anything, unless he is a doctor. So, in the course
of the argument, Bard offered to bet Wyeth five dollars,
that the state of Iowa had more automobiles than California,
in proportion to its population. Wyeth called
him, and they put up the money.</p>

<p>"I heard Bard explaining to one of their friends, that
Iowa had so many automobiles; but was away down
when it came to population. Wyeth overheard him, and
agreed that Iowa <i>did</i> have lots of machines, but that he
was wrong in regard to its being away down in population.
That, in fact, Iowa had almost as many people as
California. The crowd ridiculed such an idea, and cited
the big cities of California, as an evidence of the fact.
'There is no call for argument when the same is down
in black and white. Look it up in the census,' Wyeth
declared. Bard colored, while Randall fished around in
his belongings, and found a book containing the last
government census report. Now, what do you think of
a bunch that are always arguing, and not one of them
knew the population of either of those great states.
Not a one, and most of them graduated from college.
Which showed that they have not studied what is around
them, while Wyeth had.</p>

<p>"The report they found, had Iowa's population for
fifteen years before. 'Wrong,' said Wyeth calmly.
'Well, here it is in black and white,' they all cried at
once. 'But it's wrong, I say,' declared Wyeth. 'You
can't convince Tempest on anything,' declared Randall
disgustedly. 'You cannot convince me that Iowa has
not increased in population in fifteen years. The census
you are poring over there, is fifteen years old.' They
were taken aback. They looked at the top of the page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and saw they were all wrong again. Not a word did they
say. No, they wouldn't admit in words to him, that they
were wrong when it was before them. Wyeth called the
population, and when they looked just to the side, there
it was. It was the same with California. And still, not
one of that bunch said: 'By jove! He's right.' No,
but they all knew then that he had won that bet. And
Dr. Bard was sick. Just sick, while Randall was sore
with himself.</p>

<p>"Now here is how they hedged and kept from paying
it: Wyeth wrote to two of the biggest motor magazines,
and to the department of commerce. The department of
commerce wrote back that the information he required,
could be gotten by consulting the magazine he had
written to, and stated what issues gave it. Wyeth
brought the issues and the letters. They then claimed
that they would accept the information from the secretaries
of the states only. He wrote to these people, and,
strange to say, they did not answer. And that was how
they hedged. There was only one of the bunch that
frequents the place regularly, who was man enough to
tell them how cheap it was, and that was Dr. Landrum.
He purchased Wyeth's book and read it, and told Wyeth
that he had done finely for a beginner; Randall has had
more criticism to offer upon it than any one else, but
would not, of course, honor Wyeth by buying one."</p>

<p>"I guess he more than paid for one, from what I have
heard," laughed Jones, and related the incident of the
bet, which had become known about town.</p>

<p>"Well," said the detective, "they are giving him the
laugh down there now, about how Randall called him
on his criticisms."</p>

<p>"I heard about that, too," said Jones. "But you take
it from me. That fellow is going to make a fool of those
fellows yet. The man has something up his sleeve
behind all this criticism he is accused of, and I am looking
for him to do something. I don't know what it will be;
but I feel in my bones, that it will be something that
we will all know about."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said the detective. "That fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
has no college education like Randall and Bard, and
others, that feel they are the only fish in the pond;
but he is a walking encyclopedia when it comes to every
day facts about our country and the people, and some
day we are going to hear from him otherwise than through
the pages of his book. He didn't know all about writing
when he wrote that; but it's some book at any rate,"
and with that, he rose and went his way.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Sunday was a beautiful day. The air was calm and
soft. A crowd was on hand early at Randall's pharmacy,
as was the usual custom on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Well," said Randall cheerfully, "today is fine.
Wonder where Tempest is." And he looked about at the
others, amusedly. A tittering went the rounds.</p>

<p>"He appears to be somewhat scarce about these premises,
since you called him some days ago," said Bard,
whereupon there was some more tittering.</p>

<p>"Well, guess I'll look over the paper, since our wise
friend isn't around to teach us something," and, smothering
his glee, he uncovered the <i>Age-Herald</i>. Laying the
funny pages aside, he allowed his gaze to fall upon the
front page of the general news section.</p>

<p>"What in Hell!" he exclaimed, in the next breath.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ran?" cried the crowd.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Negro says race faces dreadful conditions,
due to lack of interest by their
leaders. Says selfishness is so much the
order that there is no interest whatever
toward uplift. Professional Negro the
worst.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Have you read this?" cried Professor Dawes, bursting
in a few minutes later. "What do you think of it?"
He was very much excited. So were many others.</p>

<p>"That Negro's crazy!" cried Professor Ewes, of the
Mater School. Professor Ewes had read Wyeth's book,
which was loaned to him by one of his teachers, who had
purchased it from one of Wyeth's agents, in two payments.
She had loaned it to Professor Ewes, and Professor
Ewes had, in turn, loaned it to Professor Dawes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Professor Dawes had, in turn, loaned it to another
professor, and after all three had read it, it was returned
to the original purchaser, who had seen the advertisement,
that it was on sale at the biggest white store in the
south, and had been inspired to subscribe for it, on that
account. When the book was returned to her, she had
read fifty odd pages and liked it, so she told Miss Palmer.
She further said, she hoped some day to know the young
man, who had written such a great story. And then
Miss Palmer told her. Forthwith, all interest became
an argument.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say, that fellow is the author of
the book?" she inquired of her professor.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said.</p>

<p>When the agent called for the remainder due, he was
handed the book, with a statement that it was positively
N.G. When the agent opened it, as he was leaving the
rear of the house of the wealthy white people, a book
mark dropped from between pages fifty and fifty-one.</p>

<p>"Did you read what he said about the teachers?" exclaimed
a supernumerary, stopping in at the drug store,
and seeing everybody excited over the article. Jones
came in behind her.</p>

<p>"This is where you come in for a big article in your
next week's issue," said Randall, who didn't take any
Negro paper, shoving the article under the eyes of the
Negro editor.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mr. Wyeth has said all I would liked to
have said," he replied calmly.</p>

<p>"What!" several cried, in consternation. "Do you
mean to say that you would have talked about the best
people as this man has!"</p>

<p>"I mean that I would have tried to. I do not consider
that I possess the ability to arrange it as he has. You
see, his range and vision is beyond mine, which has been
confined to the southland. While he has studied every
section of the country we call the United States, and he
has, as you will observe, written this article in appreciation
of that point of view."</p>

<p>"But, great goodness, Jones," cried Randall, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
much excited, and likewise forgetting that he did not
subscribe for nor advertise in Jones' paper, which was
the best Negro paper in the state. Because, he said to
everybody but Jones himself, it was N.G., and didn't
pay to advertise in it. "See what he has said about our
teachers!"</p>

<p>"I have seen it. What of it?"</p>

<p>"It's dreadful&mdash;terrible!"</p>

<p>"About the park and library, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"How can you say that&mdash;or anything to the contrary,
when you know all he has related there is true?"</p>

<p>Randall hesitated embarrassed for a moment, then
said: "But he needn't have made such an issue of it!"</p>

<p>"But it's true?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;of course it's true. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And about this crime, etc.?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He shouldn't have told it where the white people
can read it," assisted Jones, grimly. Those about became
quiet very quickly, and looked at each other. Jones saw
the lay of the land, and took his leave.</p>

<p>"At last, at last!" he cried to himself, as he went up
the street, "the turning point has been reached. When
I write again of civic conditions in my paper, and show
up the fallacies among our own, it'll be read and notice
taken of it."</p>

<p>All that day, indignation meetings denouncing the
article by Sidney Wyeth, was the order among Effingham's
black people. All the week following, it was
further denounced. And thus we come to the end of
this part of our story.</p>

<p>As for Sidney Wyeth, he left Effingham. He left
shortly after writing the article, and went to another
city. In that other city, he came back to where he
started&mdash;that is, something had come back to him which
was his dream, when we met him in the beginning of our
story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mildred Latham left the church, she hurried to
her room, greatly excited. Without delay, she threw her
belongings together as quickly as possible, and without
care. When she had them tied and ready for moving,
she went out, locking the door behind her, and paused
briefly to gaze up and down the street. After a moment,
in which she satisfied herself that neither were in sight,
she hurried down the street to where she knew a man
lived who owned a dray.</p>

<p>"Can you get a trunk and other matter for me at
once?" she inquired, subduing her excitement.</p>

<p>"I guess so. Sometime this afternoon. What number,
Miss," he replied, regarding her with admiring eyes. She
bit her lips in vexation.</p>

<p>"But I would like it moved at once&mdash;right away," she
said, quelling her excitement as best she could.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Didn't know you were in such a
hurry." He called to a black boy in the rear, and, after
instructions, turned to her and said:</p>

<p>"Fo'kes out, eh! He-he! Where you want it
dumped?"</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;&mdash;why, yes&mdash;oh,&mdash;you may just keep it here
until I call for it, please." Without further words, she
hurried away. Down the street she came to a boy with
a push cart, directed him to the address, let him in, saw
to the loading of her luggage, and, when this was completed,
slipped quietly out behind him. When a few
doors away, she paused long enough to gaze longingly
in the direction of the number she had just left. And
then, after a smothered sob, she caught a car that took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
her miles to another side of town, and where the houses
were recently built near a new extension of the car
tracks.</p>

<p>Two hours later, she had succeeded in getting a room
from a woman who had a daughter about her age. She
would get her meals at a small restaurant nearby, until
she could arrange to cook them in her room, or, maybe,
she might be allowed to cook them in the kitchen, on the
stove of the family. She didn't request that privilege
this day, for she was too greatly excited to say more
than she had to.</p>

<p>"It's terrible," she moaned silently, when alone in the
room she had secured. "I would not have left them
like this for anything in the world; but I could never
stay there and take the risk. I could never look in their
faces again.... But, oh, how I dislike to be away from
them! It is almost the only real home I ever knew, and
the only ones who ever really loved me&mdash;but Sidney....
I must not think of him, I must forget. But can I?
That is what has worried me these months. I can never
forget how he looked at me that day; that day when he
would have spoken....</p>

<p>"And then he came.... That night&mdash;but that was the
end, the end of my dream. And yet, only yesterday, I
don't know why, I couldn't seem to help it; but I had
hopes, dear hopes&mdash;but today&mdash;&mdash;" She went to
sleep after a time, and all the night through, was asleep
and awake by turns. It seemed that morning would
never come; and when it did at last, she arose with
heavy eyes.</p>

<p>She decided to go for a walk, and not canvass that
morning. She was glad now that Constance's work was
in another part of the city, and she could at least go
about hers without any likelihood of meeting her.</p>

<p>"Did you rest well last night?" inquired the lady of
the house, a hard-faced dark woman, whose appearance
did not appeal to Mildred the night before, and now
she was less impressed than before.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, thank you," she replied quickly. So
much so that the other looked at her keenly, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Mildred saw her eyes now, she detected an air of suspicion
therein. She flinched perceptibly. The other saw this,
and was more suspicious still.</p>

<p>"You seem worried, nervous," said the other, with
feigned kindness; but even in the tone, could be discerned
a mockery.</p>

<p>"I never sleep well when I change rooms and sleep in
a new bed," said Mildred, calmly. The other nodded.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter," the other announced, as a
tired looking black girl came forward. Mildred accepted
the introduction with forced courtesy, and only returned
the greeting. The other did likewise, while her mother,
appearing to wish to tantalize the feelings of her roomer,
said:</p>

<p>"You and she can be partners. You must take her,
Myrtle, around to see your friends." She now turned to
Mildred and said: "Myrtle has many admirers, so you
and she can go out anytime and turn on a 'stunt.'"
She smiled a dry hard smile, that almost made Mildred
shudder. She made an excuse, and hurried into the
street, preferring the outside air to the evil atmosphere
she felt within.</p>

<p>"That gal's crooked," said the black woman to her
daughter, who had just come in that morning.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said the other coldly.</p>

<p>"How do I know!" she repeated derisively. "Do
you suppose I have been in this town and seen a thousand
gals with her sweet face, and not know that she ain' got
a white man&mdash;maybe two or three&mdash;on her string."</p>

<p>"You're crooked&mdash;so crooked yourself, Ma, that you
see everybody else the same way," said the other, sinking
into a chair and closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"I've always tried to make you straight, and you
know that," her mother retorted grimly.</p>

<p>"A crooked mother can't raise a straight daughter.
It's up to the daughter&mdash;and I've failed." A moment
later, she was snoring loudly. The other regarded her
now, with a pang in her evil heart. It always made her
sad to see her only daughter like that. She had fostered
hopes, while this one was growing up, that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
be a lady; she had sent her to school with the funds
she got in any way she could; but heredity was too
strong. They wouldn't have the girl after six months,
at the boarding school she attended in Grantville. No,
they expelled her with an emphatic letter, that she
should not return the following season. She swore when
she read the letter from the president, and forthwith
sent her to another. The offense was repeated. She
sent her then to a catholic convent. But in some way
she escaped from this, and when her mother saw her
two months later, she was living in adultery.</p>

<p>Mildred renewed her canvass that afternoon, and,
under the spell of the work, she was able, after a time,
in part, to forget the worry that possessed her. She
returned to her room, humming a little song, much to
the surprise of herself. She hushed, however, when she
approached the house. The face of the black woman
seemed more cruel every time she saw it. She wished
she had another place. But, since she had moved in,
she decided to make the best of it.</p>

<p>All that week she worked away diligently. She worked
to forget what had frightened her away from her friends,
and her success was great. She placed the book in scores
of homes through her concentrated efforts, and when
she returned at night, she was invariably so much exhausted,
that she retired early, and fell asleep the minute
she touched the bed, and awakened each morning, rested
and spurred on to a greater effort.</p>

<p>Sunday came again, and, having grown accustomed to
attending church, she knew it would be a long day for
her without doing so. She inquired of the people regarding
a church, and was embarrassed to have the woman
remark:</p>

<p>"Oh, you attend church! Well, there's a big Baptist
church down the street and across five blocks; while
there's a smaller one two blocks up."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mildred so sweetly, that the other
looked after her with open mouth.</p>

<p>"I can't make that gal out," she said to her daughter,
as they sat together at breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," growled the daughter, without looking
up.</p>

<p>"She's a puzzle. Sells a book; but I will never bring
myself to believe that she doesn't do something else on
the side."</p>

<p>"Evil to him who evil thinks," said her daughter, still
looking in her plate. "I think I might possibly have
been something, Ma, if you hadn't been so evil. Now
what right have you trying to trump up something
against that girl. Supposing she ain't straight, does that
give you any call for all time tryin' t' make her what
she ain' showed herself t' be?" Myrtle was impatient,
and her mother had a way of hushing up when she was
in this mood.</p>

<p>"She c'n certainly make herself look good," commented
the black woman, as Mildred passed out, and
went down the street in the direction given to the big
church.</p>

<p>"Has got some clothes, too," she commented further,
as the other remained silent. "She certainly knows how
t' have her men. Don't none of'm bother about where
she lives; and 'she goes t' church on Sunday.'" She
laughed a low, hard laugh, but did not look in her
daughter's direction.</p>

<p>Mildred found the church. It was indeed a large
structure. And a large crowd attended it. She sat to
one side, where a window was raised, and the soft air
floated in above her. As she caught the strains of the
mammoth pipe organ, and heard the music from a score
or more voices in the choir, she thought of her friends
as never before, since she left them. She had told
Wilson&mdash;who was so good&mdash;that some day he'd be the
pastor of a big church. A big church like this, where
thousands of people attended. Only forty members comprised
his congregation; he was delighted, she recalled,
when as many as one hundred attended. And she had
wanted so much to help Wilson Jacobs and his sister in
their great effort. As she recalled how unceremoniously
she had left them, and at the very time they needed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
more than ever, she experienced a pain that made her
turn in the pew.</p>

<p>She heard the pastor now. He was preaching. She
settled herself for a long sermon. That was the kind the
Baptists preached, she judged. Soon she found herself
listening to the words that came from his lips. He told
the story of Damon and Pythias. How glorious, she
thought! Pythias was a man&mdash;and so was Damon.
They were strong men&mdash;with, what was that, she was
thinking of it all the time? Yes, they were strong men
with the strength of their convictions. "Amen" came
all about her. And still the pastor was preaching. And
he was preaching a good sermon. She heard it all, and
it concerned men&mdash;and the strength of their convictions.</p>

<p>"To be a Christian," she heard him now, "you must
be strong. You must be courageous, and willing to
sacrifice for your brother, as was Damon for Pythias.
There are those who are Christians with all the feeling&mdash;on
Sunday. Monday, they are like any other sinner. This
version of Christianity and religion, is the reason Hell is
getting so many people every day. Sometimes when I
think it over, I don't wonder; because, all my life, I
have been constrained to observe, that too many people
regard Jesus as the individual, and not as the moral.
It is the moral of the Christ, his teachings and example,
that we are to follow. We do not know him, insofar as
the Christian sense is concerned, as an individual. But
it is a fact that so many of our preachers wax eloquent,
and literally bring down the heavens, and, likewise,
great demonstration from the congregation thereby.
But, to be a successful practitioner, one must be strong;
he must stand for something; to be a successful farmer,
a man must be practical; to be a successful business
man, requires application and fortitude; to be a good
husband, and the father of a happy family, requires
strength&mdash;in short, to be anything in this life, requires
strength! Therefore, dear friends, fancy, if you can,
how a weak man can be a Christian. For, to be a
Christian, requires the strength of all things."</p>

<p>She was moved. Oh, it was a relief to listen to a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
sermon! And she was glad to hear a Baptist preacher
speak so forcibly in such terms. She was not so very
well acquainted with this denomination and its pastors;
but, from her observation, she had almost concluded
that they appealed to the emotion, rather than to strength.
She wondered now, as she saw him making gestures in
emphasizing his words, whether he had taken any interest
in the Y.M.C.A. She decided to find out, if she became
an attendant of this church.</p>

<p>When the sermon had closed, she contributed liberally
to the table, whereupon she was looked at closely by the
man who took collections. When she had reseated herself,
and glanced in the direction of the table, she saw
the man pointing her out to the pastor, whose eyes, for
a moment, rested upon her in curiosity.</p>

<p>When she was leaving the church at the close of the
services, someone touched her arm. She turned quickly,
with a pang of the heart, recalling with fright, having
been touched a week before. She had no need to fear,
however. It was the man who had taken collections.</p>

<p>"The pastor would like a word with you, Madam," he
said, with his hat in his hand, and all politeness. She
blushed, and then, turning, followed him back into the
church, where she came upon the pastor, standing among
several people.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, advancing as soon as she drew near.
"And this is the young lady we observed. Pardon me,
Miss, but you are a stranger among us. We wish you to
feel welcome in our church. I hope the service didn't
bore you." He was a good man. Her ideal of a true
Christian. She replied with embarrassment, and blushed
fearfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed not, Sir! I enjoyed the service&mdash;oh,
ever so much! And I am delighted to be made welcome
here. I hope to come to services very often&mdash;every
Sunday. I think you preached a wonderful sermon!"
She paused now, too embarrassed to go on. He saw it,
and made haste to dispell it. Introductions followed,
and invitations were the order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>It was over now, and she was happy. At that moment,
she felt at peace with the world. And this included the
evil black woman with whom she roomed, and who
didn't attend church. She grasped the hands that now
sought hers, and murmured kind words. Then she
turned, and before her stood the man with the scar.
She uttered a low cry, and the next moment, fell prone
upon her face, in a dead faint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TWO_3" id="CHAPTER_TWO_3"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>It Was In That Church Last Sunday!</i>"</p>


<p>The Sunday following Mildred's departure was a sad
one in the Jacobs' household. Since she came to it
months before, Sunday had always been distinguished
from other days. It was then that all talked and smiled,
and indulged at length in other pastimes that make
home happy. And that is why today was the saddest
day they&mdash;Constance and her brother&mdash;felt they had
ever experienced. Neither could keep their gaze from
wandering to the empty chair, and down in the hearts of
each was a constant cry, though both surpressed it with
a mighty effort: "Where is she today?"</p>

<p>It was Wilson who broke the silence. Was it perhaps
the one woman who had filled that empty chair only
last Sunday, gay, cheerful, happy and hopeful? Wilson
Jacobs felt as though he should choke. Constance saw
his emotion 'ere he spoke, and experienced a choking
sensation also. She hadn't become reconciled to the
absence, and all the week through, she had been like
one in a trance.</p>

<p>"Can we ever give Mildred up, Constance?" Constance
did not reply. She did not raise her head for
fear he might happen to see her eyes. But after a time,
she could hold back the tears no longer. All at once
they came in a flood, and her whole being gave up to
convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>"There, there, dear," he cried, rising and coming
hurriedly around to where she sat. Whereupon she
became worse. He raised her to a standing posture, and
took her affectionately in his arms, but the weeping went
on unchecked. He held her and stroked her hair with
his hand, but said nothing. He could not, for he was
too overcome himself. By and by, he knew it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
pass, and then they would speak of her in the terms they
had known her. She was a good girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wilson, I will never get over it&mdash;never, never,
never!" Constance moaned and gripped him convulsively.
"Just think of it, too, and when we were
beginning to realize how much she was to both of us.
And just think how she acted about the Y.M.C.A.!
Went to the bank and drew all the money she had saved
this summer, walking by day in the sun to sell the book,
and gave it, every dollar of it, to the cause of our people!"
She cried harder now than ever. He drew her closer,
and as he did so, one tear dropped from his eye upon
her hair. She never felt it, and he would not have had
her know for anything. He was a strong man, and had
ever kept from tears.</p>

<p>"If we could only do something, only help a little,"
he said now, in a constrained voice. "I would give the
rest of my life to the cause of that girl," he said, with
words that spelled of fire. "Whatever this lurking evil
is that has driven her from the protection of those who
love her, <i>it was in that church last Sunday</i>!" He paused
now, and while he stood silent, his sister released herself,
looking at him for a moment sympathetically, and then
sank again into the chair.</p>

<p>Their breakfast had been neglected, forgotten, and was
growing cold. "Come, Wilson," she called softly, and
pointed to his plate. He heard her and obeyed. They
ate in absolute silence, automatically putting from their
minds the emotion that had possessed them.</p>

<p>And even as he ate the food, with the strength it
required to force it down, his mind played about the
incident connected with her strange leaving. He tried
vainly to recall who was at the church that he did not
know. And it occurred to him that there were many.
Yes. There were many; then he remembered suddenly
how cheered he had been, when he saw his little church
filled to its capacity. He recalled with a pang, that, as
he stood at the rostrum, Mildred had passed, and, upon
seeing him, had glanced at the congregation that had
gathered, and then back at him and smiled. He con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>tinued
his meal, but he knew he could never forget that
smile.</p>

<p>Mildred Latham had wanted to help him. And when
she saw his small church filled with people that day,
some there purposely, while others were merely curious,
she had, in that smile, shown how glad she was. It was
that unselfishness about her, which was evident in many
little ways, and which had finally won him.</p>

<p>And she had played and sung that day with all the
strength of her body and soul. She had struggled in
every way she knew how, to help him in his great effort.
She had gone to the bank and drawn all she had saved in
the months he had known her, as further evidence of her
regard for this human welfare. She had acted, in doing
so, at the most opportune time. With such a sum from
an unknown girl, others, during the week, had surprised
even themselves by subscribing sums that made the
success of his work seemed assured. And cash was given
where it might not have been otherwise. He knew his
people a little. And when someone started the ball
rolling, by means of patience, fortitude, hard work and
application to the task, others can be found who will
keep it going.</p>

<p>And why had Mildred Latham done this? Certainly
she had not done so because she was in love with him.
She had never shown any affection for him in that way.
She had been interested in him, because she felt that he
was sincere in his effort to help his fellow men. And she
had given the sum to the proposed Y.M.C.A., because
she was <i>interested in humanity</i>, and that was her mite
to prove it....</p>

<p>And on the heels of this, she had&mdash;almost in the same
moment, been driven from the place she had appreciated
as home.... Who was this beast, for positively he was
a beast.... When he got to a man in the case, he could
never go further. For, think as he might, he could not,
in some way, connect her with a man. A man it might
be; but he felt positive she had no relation with anyone.
And yet, what was it? Just something, and after that,
all was blank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>They had finished their meal now. And he rose and
strolled out upon the porch. He drew a cigar and,
lighting it, started to smoke. It was a beautiful morning,
and one to make even the sorrowful happy. But Wilson
Jacobs was not happy. He gave up to the delight of the
moment, and for a time, he forgot the harrowing sorrows.</p>

<p>The trees that lined the street were heavy with foliage,
and gave forth the sound of many song birds; while a
soft wind made the leaves rustle ever so little.</p>

<p>Presently, a man came down the street. On he came
until he was even with the house, and then, for a brief
spell, he paused at the gate. Until then, he had apparently
not observed the man sitting on the porch.
He glanced up and saw him. Then, with something
akin to an air of guilt, the stranger passed on, and, as
he did so, Wilson gave a start. His thoughts flew back
over the past, with electric rapidity. Where had he
seen that man before? "Where, where, where?" His
thoughts were fairly alive. His lips grasped the cigar so
tightly, that the lighted end fell to the floor, for he had
bitten it in two, in his excitement. He kicked it from
him with impatience, while he ransacked his brains in
deep thought. "Where, where, where?" he cried, now
almost aloud. And, strange as it seemed, in some way
he connected this man with the disappearance of Mildred
Latham. He raised his hands to his head to steady the
thumping there, which by now had reached a state of
violence. Just then the sexton rang the bell of his church
next door. The same broke forth upon the clear morning
air in stentorian tones, and floated beyond, and then
Wilson Jacobs sat up quickly, bolt upright.</p>

<p>"I have it! <i>I have it!</i>" he cried in a subdued voice,
while his very frame trembled. "It was at the meeting.
That man came in late, I recall it all now. He came in
late and I saw him. He, I recall now, appeared to have
no interest in the service; but his eyes sought something,
and then I caught him looking at Mildred with a
cunning expression!" Why had he not thought of this
before? It was all clear to him now, as he arose.</p>

<p>And then it occurred to him to follow. He tore into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the house, and seizing his hat, hurried out and through
the yard, came into the street and looked in the direction
which he had seen the other take. No one was in sight.
He hesitated a moment, and then hurried forward in
that direction. He presently came abreast of a house
where people sat upon the porch. He halted a moment
as they called out his name pleasantly, bidding him good
morning. He calmed himself, and after returning the
greeting, inquired quite casually whether a man had
passed that way recently, and he gave a description
of him.</p>

<p>"No; but such a man as you describe came down as
far as the corner back there," one of them explained,
"and turned in that direction," and he pointed west.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he nodded calmly, and then retreated
until he came to the place the other had turned. He
stood for a moment, apparently lost in thought, while
the people on the porch stared at him carelessly. A
moment later, he passed in the direction the other had
taken.</p>

<p>But, while he had been advised that the other had
gone in that direction, no one was in sight, he now saw
with sinking heart. He walked for two blocks, making
inquiries as he went, but no one had seen such a man.
He was downcast for a time. Presently, he returned to
his home in a disappointed mood. As he came by the
church, the doors were open, and his few members were
filing scatteringly in. He hurried into his clothes, and
a few minutes later, stood before his congregation reading
the text.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Uh! 'es Got'im a Nigga!</i>"</p>


<p>When Mildred awakened, she found herself stretched
upon a pew, with her head in a woman's lap, while the
pastor and many others whom she had met a few minutes
before, stood about with anxious expressions. Two ladies
were fanning her face vigorously. She awoke with a
start, and recalled quickly the moment she had fainted.
She had never done so before, and had often wondered
how people must feel when they fainted. She knew now;
but that was not what she thought of, when it became
clear to her. The man was her chief concern. She sat
up and looked about her quickly. If she saw him, she
felt that she must certainly lose consciousness again.</p>

<p>He was gone. With a sigh, she sank back into the
arms of the woman for a moment. The fanning was more
vigorous now than ever. All was quiet about her. She
did not first understand it. Was it because they were
afraid it might disturb her; or was it&mdash;had they seen&mdash;and
<i>understood</i>? She was too weak just then to speculate
about the situation; but she was delighted to hear
the pastor say, a moment later, stroking her forehead
kindly:</p>

<p>"You feel better now, Miss?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and felt now like crying. She understood
facial expressions, and they had not seen. She was so
relieved&mdash;for the present, and did not think then of the
future. She had that to worry over later, and for this
moment at least, she was relieved. These good people
hadn't suspected the cause of her swoon. She sat up
now, smiled with thanks upon those about her, and
wiped the cold perspiration from her forehead. Someone
held her hat, which they now handed to her. She
placed it upon her head, covering the mass of hair that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
many were looking at a moment before, with natural
admiration. Thanking them again in a kind and embarrassed
manner, she turned and left them, while they
followed to the door, and went their many ways.</p>

<p>When she got back to her room, she experienced a
spell of nervousness when she entered. She saw the
black woman's face for a moment, and was again relieved.
The other had not been there, so she nodded coldly,
and entered her room. She closed the door, and, removing
her apparel, got into a kimono and threw herself
upon the bed.</p>

<p>She had no thoughts for a time, but surrendered herself
to idleness for perhaps a half hour, and then her
mind began to react. It took the form of reminiscence.
Sidney Wyeth came back into her memory, and for a
long time she lay thinking entirely of him.</p>

<p>It was he&mdash;and he never knew what had started her
on this strange journey. She now recalled&mdash;or tried to
recall why. And then after a time she knew. Yes.
She loved Sidney Wyeth, and it was that which had
made the difference. But what kind of love was this
that had no hope? And yet did she not hope?</p>

<p>As she lay with the hot air floating in upon her, she
gazed out into the street, where a dozen or so little black
boys played. She thought, with her mind idly drifting,
and she saw these boys as men, in her idle fancy. They
gathered presently in a circle, and when she watched
them in her half-conscious, half-waking manner for a
few minutes, she saw they were shooting craps. Think
of it! These boys, ranging in years from eight to twelve.
And they were already engaged in that demoralizing
pastime. She trembled with sorrow as she watched the
game proceed. Soon she saw that an argument of some
kind had come up. They became very demonstrative,
and while this was going on, suddenly, from a remote
direction, a blue-coated policeman appeared upon the
scene. There was a scramble and they flew in many
directions. All escaped, with the exception of one. He
was a cripple, and as he tried to hobble away, the burly
cop swooped down upon him. He grasped him, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
regard for his infirmity, and disappeared up the street,
dragging the cripple with him.</p>

<p>And that was a common occurrence in this city.
Hundreds of young men&mdash;boys&mdash;were started on a
career of crime by premeditated arrests. They were
often placed in jail when they were so young, that it was
a tragedy. When they came out&mdash;for the courts could
not bring themselves to sentence below a certain age&mdash;they
were then pointed at as having "been in jail." And
since they had the name, they often thereafter diligently
sought the game.</p>

<p>As the policeman passed up the street with the pitiful
cripple, she rushed to the window to look after him.
A little boy stuck his head through a broken fence, and
she heard him say, as they went by: "Uh! 'es got 'im
a nigga!"</p>

<p>Mildred stretched herself upon the bed again; but her
thoughts were now of something else. The Y.M.C.A.
and Wilson Jacobs. At this same hour last Sunday, she
had been with him in his effort&mdash;his great effort. And
the need of such an effort had just been demonstrated a
few minutes before, almost beneath her very eyes.</p>

<p>There was no place to go; no place, as a rule, where
young men would go, and this helped to make it so bad.
Young men will play pool, some of them, and they will
seek some kind of diversion, other than the church.
Their natures call for these things, and she knew it.
Since freedom, the Negro has not been sufficiently
practical to appreciate this point of view. Plenty of
churches are available, and services are held all day
Sunday. And it is easy, so easy, to say they ought to
go&mdash;everybody <i>ought</i> to go. But <i>does</i> everybody go?
<i>Would</i> everybody go? And the most discouraging part
of it is that <i>everybody does</i> not go.</p>

<p>Some young men, if there were a clean place to go and
indulge in the pastimes that are a custom with many of
them, would be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity.
Yes, they would be glad. And, by so doing,
they would perforce meet others, who were likewise seeking
amusement. Thus brought together, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
know and appreciate the good in each other. And still
further, when they would go their many ways in life,
they would naturally spread the gospel of good, or whatever
was worth while. Such was the natural tendency
of environment. She had just witnessed such an example,
a mere incident in the city's life. Those boys had not all
known the game when they began to play. But those
who did know it, and had likewise learned it from somebody
else, had, of course, in turn taught it to these
others, who would in turn teach it still to others, and
so on. Evil environment, bad influence. She had seen
these lurking evils in so many places in this city of the
south. And, as the months went by, they took heavy
toll in startling numbers among the black children.</p>

<p>The effort of Wilson Jacobs would not soon be appreciated.
It would take years for all these young men
to see and know the real worth of such an institution.
But it was the duty of society, nevertheless (and what
was the church but the center of society), to put forward
all its efforts toward the evolution of its members.</p>

<p>Oh, some day Mildred Latham hoped she could do more.
Apparently, for the present, she had done her best. But,
as to how she could continue doing that which she loved
better than anything else to do, helping others, she could
not now see clearly. She had no plans whatever for the
future, as she lay stretched across the bed this warm
afternoon. She had no thought of leaving the city, and
still, she now knew that it was only a question of time
when she would hear from this man again. He had said
nothing, but she had read evil in his eyes. He <i>would</i>
strike sooner or later, of that she was sure. But she
was now resigned to the inevitable. She decided to
continue her work the next day, and to be brave. She
was away from those whom she would dislike to see
embarrassed. Maybe he might go about his business, if
he had any, and let her alone. That was all she asked.
If he spoke to her again, and forced himself upon her,
she would ask him to do so. She would even beg him
not to annoy her. And in the next thought, she realized
how useless this would be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>She was in the street now, and was walking along.
This part of the city stood upon a considerable hill, and
some distance away ran the mighty river. Its muddy
water could be seen from where she stood. In that
moment, she wanted to be within its shining ripples.
They led to the mightier ocean, hundreds of miles below.
Impulsively she now sought the river, and decided to
walk all the way. She had walked to it when she had
stayed with her dear friends&mdash;yes, very often. And then,
as she thought of them, a fear arose in her bosom, that
she might possibly meet them. That would never do,
and she turned back. Oh, why could she not meet them?
How much would it have meant to her to feel herself in
Constance's arms; to feel those kisses upon her cheek,
and to know that someone loved her. Yes, to see Wilson,
and appreciate his great kindness. When these pleasant
thoughts had spent themselves, she realized they could
never be anything more to her. No. She could go back there,
and they would take her in and ask no questions; they
would be good to her, and appreciate her desire to do
good; but it would always be different&mdash;now. No.
Her life was before her&mdash;she must work out her own
destiny. Whither would it lead? She made no effort to
answer this question.</p>

<p>She thought now of Wyeth. She formed his name with
her lips, and spoke it aloud, and was made strangely
happy and forgetful of that which troubled her, when
she heard it pronounced. She repeated it: "Sidney."
Oh, but to hear him call to her now as he did that day!
The day they danced, and she had heard him stifle the
passion; she had seen his eyes, and they had hypnotised
her; and, in that moment of sweet insanity, she had not
resisted the kiss that she saw he would imprint. No.
And she had never been sorry. Somehow, that one
moment had been her guiding star. She would continue
into the future, and thus it would always continue so.</p>

<p>She arrived at the place&mdash;not home. She could never
call this place home; but where she had her room. She
came around to the rear; she did not know why. And
then she was sorry too. Ranged about, without regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
as to how they sat, were men and women. Their faces
were flushed, while their smiles were amorous. She
almost choked as she begged pardon, and hurried around
to the front. She had not gotten out of reach of their
voices, when she heard the men say: "Gee! Some kid!
Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Aw, she's a little nicey, nicey girlie, that don't drink,
nor smoke, nor chew, nor&mdash;anything; but goes t' church
on Sunday," the black woman answered, and laughed a
nasty laugh.</p>

<p>She was in her room and was glad she was shut away
from the comment. To forget it, she busied herself with
the names of her subscribers, and worked over the same
until the sun had disappeared for the day, and twilight
was in the air. She lit a small lamp, drew down the
shade, and, taking up <i>The Tempest</i>, read until sleepiness
drove her to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>"Please Go!" She Cried Hoarsely</i></p>


<p>Weeks had passed, and Mildred Latham had not seen
the man since that Sunday at church. She had become
an active worker in the big Baptist church. She had
no thought of becoming so, but, somehow, she couldn't
keep out of it. Such a great crowd of people attended it
each Sunday! But they are not the select class of people
she had met at the Presbyterian. They consisted of all
classes, and from every walk in life. Among them,
she met many of her subscribers, and was pleased
to be remembered by them. They impressed her, all of
them, as being good people. In fact, she could never
believe many of them bad. They were simple and too
free in their thoughts&mdash;when they had any. They impressed
her, at times, as so many children. Many of
those who came to the church regularly, did not, she observed,
pay the least attention to the sermon. For the
most part, the large majority could not even have
remembered the text.</p>

<p>And yet they came every Sunday in great numbers,
in droves even. Many of them were very beautifully
dressed. There were no kinky heads among them,
albeit, the original had been so. The most of the hair
which was theirs by birth was all straight, while the
acquired portion was beautifully matched.</p>

<p>But the point that reconciled her, was the fact that
the pastor was a good man, and a fit one. He preached
always the sermon that spoke of practical uplift. And
this, she judged, after a time, was why he was not liked
by all, and why also, a great many made not the slightest
effort to listen to his sermons.</p>

<p>"Aw, Reverend Castle don't preach this religion lak I
wants to hear it preached," some complained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"Um&mdash;m!" exploded others.</p>

<p>"They ain' no 'ligion no mo' 'mong the people; they
is all out fo' style!" still others said.</p>

<p>And thus it went. "Out for style," was, in a great
measure, quite true; but Reverend Castle's sermons
could easily be understood, if those who attended made
any effort whatever to do so. But they did not, and
Mildred could never reconcile herself to this.</p>

<p>Back in Cincinnati, she recalled when she used to
attend a certain theatre. The only reason colored people
were allowed to purchase admittance, was because they
did not come in great numbers. There were theaters
where they were denied entrance, because they made
such disgusting disturbances. And it was only because
they would come and make no effort to understand the
performance, unless it was something below par, and
something entirely comic.</p>

<p>In this city, she had attended a great motion picture
drama. It was a play built upon an incident in the
history of the struggle for Christianity&mdash;the effort to overthrow
the power of Caesar. Above all, it was a play for
Christians, which these multitudes professed very loudly
to be. And yet the entire performance was disturbed by
the gallery, where only the <i>black</i> people were allowed to
sit. They were assigned this portion, because so few
understood or made any effort to understand the play.
These were some of the facts in the lives of her people,
which exposed the Negro to the contempt of the white
race.</p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs and Reverend Castle were preachers of
a new type, and there were many other such ministers;
but the masses continued to preach in the old style,
regardless of the fact that many had prepared themselves
to preach as these men did. The old type still continued
to work upon the emotional fibre of the congregation.
And, likewise, in so doing, others were disturbed who
wished to be taught. But the sermons of Reverends
Jacobs and Castle were not disturbed by emotional
demonstrations. The people were, if the truth be known,
inspired to higher ideals and a more lofty conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
life. Christ was pictured in such sermons, not as the
moralist, but in the highest type of perfection, as an
incentive to noble conduct.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Autumn finally came with its many varied tints, and
the leaves were falling. Jack Frost had placed his
feathery designs for the third time upon the window
panes, and, in the meantime, the work for social betterment
went on apace.</p>

<p>The effort toward the securing of the colored Y.M.C.A.,
as it was referred to, had proceeded to the extent that
it was on everybody's lips. Wilson Jacobs had proved
to be a secretary of unusual efficiency.</p>

<p>Mildred kept herself informed of it through the columns
of the papers, and was always delighted to see that subscriptions
were being paid to an encouraging degree;
but she saw that, of the thirty-five thousand dollars to be
raised by the colored people of the city, only six thousand
dollars had been paid in, after two months campaigning.
This was encouraging, nevertheless, for Grantville, with
a much more intelligent Negro population, had only
secured two-thirds of this amount at the end of six months.
Yet twenty-nine thousand dollars were to be paid in.
This amount had been over subscribed, but, getting the
money was a different story. Would the black people of
this town pay the twenty-nine thousand dollars before, or
by the first of the coming year? For, on that day, the
time limit of the Jew's contribution would expire; also,
that from other sources; but it was the money from the
Jew philanthropist, that figured most prominently.
Frankly, when Mildred saw it, she smothered her doubts
as to their ability of obtaining the desired amount.</p>

<p>Rallies for the purpose of raising money were given
weekly, but winter-time was approaching, and colored
people very often had little set aside for such a purpose.
Then, already work was shutting down, and had shut
down in many cases. Hard times had been felt for some
time, but were beginning to be felt more so. Men by
the hundreds walked the streets in search of employment,
and found instead, trouble. Arresting for vagrancy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
been stopped by the order of the court. Many preferred
being locked up, for they complained it was so difficult
to secure bread, and even at times an impossibility;
whereas, while locked up, they could eat. And that
meant much.</p>

<p>Churches were now begging for money to buy coal;
the annual interest on indebtedness was past due, and
Reverend Castle did double work&mdash;the Y.M.C.A. and
his church.</p>

<p>And it was about this time, when one evening Mildred
returned from her work, and was informed by the black
woman, that she had a caller. She was surprised, and
looked it. The black woman was too, and she likewise
looked it. Moreover, she made comment. Mildred had
never had a caller before.</p>

<p>"A gentleman," said the other, when the look of
surprise spread over her face. The other winked and
continued: "Some guy, too. Yes, swell," and laughed
in a way which Mildred always disliked to hear.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" she presently inquired, thinking of
someone with a growing fear.</p>

<p>"Didn't leave no name; said you wouldn't know it
nohow," whereupon her black face took on a look that
was tantalizing. Mildred ended it by going to her room.
She felt the call would be repeated. And then would
come the climax. She experienced a tired feeling. This
being sought by one whom she did not seek, was nerve-racking;
but she steeled herself for the ordeal. She
hoped, since she now felt that he would call, that he
would come again that same evening, and she would
have it over.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>She was about to retire, but not to sleep. For, as the
time passed, her nerve began to break under the strain
of waiting, and she was fatigued.</p>

<p>"The gentleman has returned, Miss," announced the
voice of the black woman, as her fingers played upon
the door. Mildred opened it forthwith, and&mdash;yes, there
he was. He pushed himself in without being asked, and,
being surprised at the intrusion, Mildred let go the knob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
whereupon he grasped it, and closed the door. He smiled
at her now; a smile that lurked, that boded no good;
and she felt this, with a heaving of the breast.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you for some time. Why don't you
bid me welcome?" he leered. Her eyes stared at him
coldly, but her bosom heaved, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Don't stare at me as if I were an iceberg," said the
other, with his smiles. "Just an old acquaintance from"&mdash;and
he jerked his thumb in the apparent direction of Cincinnati.
He smiled a cruel, hard smile, as he did this,
dropped uninvited into a chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Have one?" he invited, and then snickered. "You
are real cute now-a-days, I observe," he tortured. "Quite
a church lady, ha, ha!" And he gave up to his mirth
for a few seconds. "Quite cute with the preachers.
Wilson Jacobs is 'bugy' 'bout you. Awful bad for you
t' get up and steal away so mysteriously." He looked
at her now with ill concealed glee, and then continued:
"I didn't know you'd 'beat' it until the next Sunday;
when I passed I didn't see you sitting on the porch with
him; but, instead, he sat there alone, looking like the
devil before dawn. About the time I saw him, he saw
me, and looked at me as if he had caught me trying to
break in his house, or something, so I lit out. I 'hunched'
you'd fled d' coup then, 'n' as I was 'beating' it down the
street in no slow gate, I see's a drayman a-greasin' his
old hack. I had a premonition this guy, the way he
regarded me, was likely to follow. So I just slips into
this old crow's nest, and gets behind some-a-his junk,
and gets int' conversation with him, and, sure enough,
it wasn't three minutes before this 'preacher' comes
walking by a-lookin' right and left for me. I laffed in
my sleeve, and continued talking with the old skate.
A bent key encountered my hand on the ground, 'n' I
raised it up. The old buzzard spied it, and cried: 'That's
a gal's key that come down heah t' have me move her in
a hurry las' Sunday. I oughtta sent it to'r, but 'lows
I ain' got the time.' Just lak a flash, I get's wise, so I
says t' 'im: 'Was she the girl that stayed up at Jacobs'?
If so, I'll carry it to her, since she's a'friend a-mine's.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
'By gad,' he coughs, ''n' I'm the one that'll let y' too,'
and looked grateful. 'Where did she move to?' I inquired
like I didn't care, and then added: 'Y' see, I
know the place by sight, but I can't find it 's I'm turned
around down here a little.' He puts me next, and I beats
it up to where youse 's roostin' 'n' I comes up, I see this
ole black hen a-workin' away with the house all open,
'n' nobody about, I dopes at once that you, sweet little
girlie, is off some'eres to church.</p>

<p>"You know the rest," and rising now, he came toward
her. "You ought t' be willin' t' give me a kiss now,
honey, for showing how hard I'm willin' to hustle for a
sight a them eyes." He advanced to where she stood.
He smiled as he came, while she recoiled from the sight
of him, and retreated. That appeared to please him, and
he began a merry chase, dodging behind chairs and
jumping up and down playfully. "Wants t' tease, eh?
That's a way with you little women, yu lak t' tease!
Ah! That's what makes us lak yu'. 'N', kid, I sho'
does lak you. You are a pretty little wench&mdash;I mean
little gal," he corrected, continuing his chase.</p>

<p>"Please go!" she cried hoarsely. "I don't know you.
I don't want to know you. Why do you torment me!"
He only smiled now, and looked grim and determined,
as he at last cornered her. Between them was a chair.
She got behind it, and grasped the back of it. He halted
on the other side, and showed his teeth for a full minute,
before he said a word, or a word was spoken.</p>

<p>"Did you hear me! Why don't you go! If you were a
gentleman, you'd go!" His eyes narrowed to mere slits,
and then he suddenly opened them wide.</p>

<p>"Just a kiss, dearie, why all this argument. Sometimes
it goes so far that it spoils all the sweetness. Just
allow me to turn this chair until I can be seated, and
then I will draw you down, nicey, upon my knee, and
everything is O.K.&mdash;see!" He now grasped the chair,
which, despite her efforts to hold it as it was, he twisted
slowly from her grasp. The next minute he had
succeeded, and nothing was between them. He made
one step in her direction, whereupon she recoiled in fright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
He caught her wrist with his right, and then with the
left, he proceeded to encircle her waist. The next moment,
she felt his hot breath in her face, and then, with her
free hand, she struck him a resounding smack full on
his cheek, with all her strength. He released her so
quickly, that he staggered backward blindly for a moment.
The next he had recovered, while his face was colored
with the blood she had brought to it. His eyes were
narrower now than ever, while his voice, as he spoke,
came in gasps.</p>

<p>"Why, you little wench! You little imp! You little
fourflusher! You little &mdash;&mdash; strike me, when I have kept
my head closed all this time, while you sailed about here
with these big niggers, the nicest little nicey. Ha!
<i>Nice</i>&mdash;<i>Hell!</i> How long do you figure these church people
would kite you about, if I told them <i>what you were back
in Cinci'</i>!"</p>

<p>She flew to the door now, and jerked it wide. A bundle
of meat with clothes on, fell in with a scream. It was
the black woman, and she had heard all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FIVE_3" id="CHAPTER_FIVE_3"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Time Limit</i></p>


<p>"What is the total, Constance?" her brother inquired
wearily, as his sister poured over a long list of figures on
a balance sheet before her.</p>

<p>"In a minute," she said and continued her figuring.
Presently, with a sigh she straightened up, and handed
him a sheet, showing a list of names, at the right of which
was registered various amounts.</p>

<p>"Seven thousand six hundred fifty-nine dollars and
fifteen cents," he repeated, half aloud. He looked at his
sister, and saw in her tired eyes, failure staring them in
the face. Unless something extraordinary occurred, the
chances of securing a Y.M.C.A. for the colored youth
of the city was doomed to failure. He laid the sheet
down, and picked up another piece of paper&mdash;a letter.
He had read it several times, but now he read it again.
He didn't want to believe what was written upon it,
and signed by the Jew philanthrophist. But it was
before him in plain, typewritten words, and was to this
effect:</p>

<blockquote class="small">
<p>
<i>Mr. Wilson Jacobs</i>,</p>
<p class="ind"><i>Secretary</i> <i>Y.M.C.A.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Receipt of your letter of December 1, is here
acknowledged. I note carefully what you say in regard to your
efforts in relation to the securing of funds for the Y.M.C.A. for
the colored youth of your city.</p>

<p>You are of course aware that my offer, made five years ago, in
which I agreed to give the sum of $25,000 to any city, where an
additional sum of $75,000 was forthcoming from other sources.
The time I made that offer was five years ago January of the coming
year. Therefore, the time will expire at twelve, December 31,
this month.</p>

<p>With regard to extending the time limit on these gifts, I regret
to say that I have made no such provision. Moreover, with the
present condition of the financial outlook, I cannot see my way<span class="spagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
clear to do so. However, all cities that report favorably up to that
date, I will fulfill my agreement.</p>

<p>Regretting that I cannot write you more favorably, but hoping
it will be possible for you to comply with my offer, I beg to remain,</p>

<p class="midind">
Very truly, <span class="smcap">J. Rosenthal</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>He laid the letter aside. He had known before he
wrote, what to expect, for announcements had come from
Grantville, that the philanthropist would not extend the
time on his gifts for this purpose. Hard times had
spread over the country, until not enough was being
collected to maintain the cost of the office and advertising,
notwithstanding the fact that they secured it at the
smallest possible rate. Both were compelled to acknowledge
now that a failure seemed imminent. To secure the
gift of the Jew, it was necessary for them to raise still
more than twenty-seven thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Could he raise such a sum in view of prevailing circumstances?</p>

<p>"Have you received a decision from the railroad
president, who personally contributed five hundred
dollars, Wilson?" Constance now inquired.</p>

<p>"The hoped for appropriations for such purposes have
been deferred indefinitely," he replied. "So there is no
hope now, only from the local interests, and they, I fear,
are hopeless."</p>

<p>"And you see no place where such a sum might be
raised&mdash;in so short a time?" she asked again, a trifle
nervous.</p>

<p>"Only to go north, and try to enlist the sympathy of
other philanthropic persons."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;will&mdash;you go?" She looked at him now,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go," he returned.</p>

<p>"May God be with us!" she sighed, and picked up
the afternoon paper. She glanced over it, and saw the
usual accounts relating to the shutting down of various
industrial concerns, and, as she looked further, there were
the same accounts regarding the colored people. The
business of fighting and stealing and getting drunk went
on more actively than usual, if such were possible. She
laid it aside presently, and picked up her subscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
list. She was still selling the book, and had a great
many sales for the holiday trade.</p>

<p>When she paid the charges on a consignment of books
a few minutes later, and unwrapped them, she thought of
her dear friend who had brought her attention to the
work. How much she would have liked to see her, she
did not conjecture; but she was glad now she had taken
up the work. The returns from the sale of it, had meant
a great deal to the home in the past months. Wilson,
who usually made some money otherwise than what he
received from the church, which was small, had been
unable to look after or give his time to anything but the
work of the Y.M.C.A. Therefore, the money from
the sale of the book had come in at an opportune time.</p>

<p>As for Mildred, the earth seemed to have swallowed
her, insofar as they had been able to ascertain. Wilson
had worried to a point where he now looked ten years
older than he had six months before. Grantville had
given up in despair. Five thousand dollars was all they
had been able to raise, and, therefore, realized how
useless it was to continue the effort, which had subsequently
come to an end. She believed in her brother;
she was confident he could raise the amount necessary,
if he had the time. If the gift from the Jew could have
been possible a year hence, she was confident he could
raise the balance; but, with less than four weeks, it
seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>And yet, "as long as there is life there is hope!" He
would go north the coming Monday&mdash;this was Friday&mdash;and
she hoped he would be successful. Until he returned,
she would not despair. She made preparations for his
departure, by packing his steamer trunk, washed his
handkerchiefs, purchased many little necessities from her
own purse, and placed them along with the rest of his
belongings.</p>

<p>"Will you go to New York or Chicago?" she inquired
as they sat at dinner.</p>

<p>"I suppose the chances are better beyond New York.
I shall, of course, go directly to New York, but from
there I will go into New England. I have credentials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
from several well known white people, as well as letters
from the secretary of the white Y.M.C.A. here, and at
Effingham and Attalia, so I think that part is quite
sufficiently looked after."</p>

<p>When Reverend Wilson Jacobs had dined, he felt like
walking, and, drawing on a light overcoat and cap, he
strolled out into the chill December night. The air was
still, and the stars gleamed brightly, as he strolled down
the street in the direction of the river. When he had
gone three blocks, he decided to walk to the river, and
look out upon its water for a spell. So, increasing his
speed, he walked briskly in that direction.</p>

<p>To reach the river by the street he was following, it
was necessary to pass through a district of the town
that had not the best reputation. It was a part of the
town, inhabited in former days by denizens of the underworld,
and was interspersed with many halls and buildings
that had been built for such purposes. Since liquor had
been voted out of the state, and the city likewise, while
the women had also been forced to scatter, due to the
enforcement of the law relative to their profession,
the neighborhood had been given over largely to bootlegging.
Places operating under the guise of soft-drink
shops, sold liquor as freely as the saloons had, when they
operated in the same places a year ago. And, in this
district, holdups and other cases of outlawry were a
common occurrence.</p>

<p>He had arrived, and was passing leisurely through this
part of the town, when, ahead of him, a figure crossed
the street, and entered one of the dives. Something
about the swing of the arms, made him recall that he had
seen that person before. He thought it over, as he approached
the place the other had entered. He had not
reached it, when the other emerged, and made his way
up the street ahead of him, only a few yards. He studied
the character, and when he turned into another place a
few doors up, he recalled where he had seen him. It was
the man who had paused before his gate months before,
and whom he had started to follow, but who had eluded
him. He saw no reason for paying him further attention
now, and passed on to the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>He returned by the same street, and as he came abreast
of an open door, he overheard voices and caught a glimpse
of the man again. He halted, and leaned beside the
door in the shade of the building a moment, out of sheer
curiosity. The voices came to his ears plainly, as he
stood there.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe she has money," said one,
whom he surmised was that of the man he had seen.</p>

<p>"If she has, you have spoiled your chances of getting
hold of any of it."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that out?" said the other gruffly.</p>

<p>"Well, what you should have done was to have communicated
with her while she was stopping up here with
that preacher and his sister, and made her come across
to keep you from putting them next. Now, 's I figure it
out, you blows in on her with your recognition game,
and frightens her out of her wits, and she flies the coup.
And then, to make matters worse, you trail her across
town to where she 'beats' it, and, instead of using a
little diplomacy, you blow in on her and frighten her
away from there. You played a deuce of a game, you
did." The tone was impatient, and, from the way the
other shifted, it was quite obvious that he was not playing
a clever one either.</p>

<p>"Well, she was such a good looking little wench that,
to be truthful, I lost my head over her," the other laughed
a low, hard laugh, as he said this.</p>

<p>"Lost your head, hump!" growled another. "I can't
get into my nut, how you blame nigga's get in your
ugly knots, that a gal that's got the sense you say this
gal has, is going to fall to a cheap nigga like yourself."
The voice showed that the speaker was plainly disgusted.</p>

<p>"Aw, old shine, I've had some a's good looking a gals
as her on my string, don't fool yourself 'bout that,"
the first speaker retorted.</p>

<p>"How much sense did they have in their nuts? None!
If they had, they'd a never fooled with you."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm still trailing her. I ain' give up yet. I'm
determined I'll bring her to time, or I'll know the reason
why," the other declared, determinedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't the ole cat down where she was roosting,
know where she has gone?" inquired the other now.</p>

<p>"Don't know a thing. Swears that she don't, and I
b'lieve her. She's a little sore 'cause I blew in and scared
her away. Funny, too, 'cause that old woman's so crooked
she cain' lay straight in bed. And, say, you know Lizzie,
the good looking black gal that comes over to Dago's
place, and licks up so much booze?"</p>

<p>"Who, Slender Liz? Sure! Why?"</p>

<p>"That's her ma."</p>

<p>"The dickens!"</p>

<p>"Sure is!"</p>

<p>"That beats the devil. I know her; but I didn't
know until this minute that Liz was her brat. And you
mean to say this little gal what you lost your head about
and chased away, was stopping with the old woman?"</p>

<p>"That was where she slapped me blind at."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be darned. I shouldn't have thought she'd
have stayed around her very long, when she got next to
what was going on."</p>

<p>"Well, the little wench was so frightened when she
left this preacher up here, that she didn't know where
she was going, and she got into the place hurriedly, and
then after she had got tied up there, she seemed to have
decided to stick it out until she could do better. Then,
besides, the old woman told me that she don't think the
gal knew she sold liquor, and ran a crap game every
Saturday night. Her room was so located that the
gamesters came and went without going near her room.
Then, the gal kept herself shut in like a prisoner, when
she was around, besides."</p>

<p>"I wish you hadn't spoiled this deal. I believe we
could have dug enough dough out of her to stake us into
a game, when we're settin' 'roun' broke like we are now."</p>

<p>"I'll get her, just be patient. I don't believe she's
left town; but I can't pull the old woman for any more
information. Besides, she ain' got over me frightening
her away, 'cause she said the gal was sure a fine roomer,
and that she is sorry now that I found her at all. These
old crooks can be won over when you come clean at that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bet your life they can. And when you get the friendship
of one like that, they'd go through fire for you."</p>

<p>There was a shuffling about now, as if someone was
coming toward the door. Wilson hurried away, and
walked rapidly in the direction of home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Black Cavalry's Charge&mdash;"Onward Boys!"</i></p>


<p>"Mildred, my Mildred, where are you, dear heart?"
said Wilson Jacobs, as he hurried in the direction of his
home, after he had overheard the words of the two men.
He was in a turmoil of excitement. He had reached no
decision as to what he would do, that is, as to how he
would find her; but he was determined that he would
search the city to the very doors, until he found and
brought back that girl to his home.</p>

<p>"She is being persecuted, being hounded out of her
life, as she has been out of the place she called her home&mdash;and
by those brutes." And he trembled with anger, as
he thought of the dastardly creatures who were pursuing
her.</p>

<p>"I could corner that brute and make him confess what
is behind this mystery; but then I have overheard him
admit that she has eluded him; therefore, that would be
useless. Until he ascertains her whereabouts, it would
be foolish even to whip the cur for his villainy." One
thing he decided on 'ere he had gone far in his reflections,
and that was to keep it from his sister. It would only
serve to upset her more, and she was worried enough
already.</p>

<p>"My poor, dear little girl; my brave little girl; and
you must bear this burden and sorrow all alone," he
murmured in a strained voice, as he approached his
abode. "Somewhere in this city she is in fear tonight,
in fear of these dark creatures. I would give half my
life to find her this very night. Oh, that I had some clue!
She would not have me find her, but that is a matter
that I would waive aside. Her happiness, even her very
life, is in danger. And, whatever this evil may be, I will
never believe, even from her own lips, that Mildred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Latham is guilty of any act that would not become a
lady. Somewhere in the past, she has, in some way,
become involved, and this, in some manner, is the occasion
of the mystery; but I have faith in her above all
others." And so, with this thought, he entered the
house and his room, where he walked for hours trying to
form some plan of action.</p>

<p>"I will find her. I <i>must</i> find her," he declared, with
compressed lips, time and again; but, as to how, no way
seemed clear. "I must leave Monday on the mission,
and I must try to find her before then. I don't care
what it is&mdash;has been, and might be in the future&mdash;I love
you, Mildred, I love you&mdash;nothing else matters. I have
faith in you; I believe in you above all others; with
your presence, under my protection, I feel I could do
the things you had faith I could do!" He almost raved
at times, during the still hours that followed.</p>

<p>All the kind words she had said to him in the months
gone by, came back to him as he trod the floor&mdash;thinking,
thinking, thinking. "You will succeed; you will become,
'ere long, a leader of men," she had said once. "For it
is you, courageous, with the strength of your convictions,
this race needs; and it is you they will eventually find."</p>

<p>She had said this with all the fervor of her soul. And
he had listened; he had hoped, and then he had worked.
Yes, Wilson Jacobs had worked hard to raise those few
thousands, that would revert back to the donors in four
weeks, if a preponderous sum was not raised by midnight
of December thirty-first. December thirty-first,
midnight? God, how that sounded in his ears now.
The fateful night! One minute after that hour, sixty-seven
thousand dollars, waiting from other sources than
the black people of this town, would be no longer available.
Seventy-three thousand dollars for the future
moral welfare of thousands of young men of this race
would no longer be available, unless he, Wilson Jacobs,
could raise twenty-seven thousand dollars in a day over
three weeks.</p>

<p>That was his burden.</p>

<p>If he, Wilson Jacobs, could raise such an amount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
innumerable black children yearly, and until the end of
time, oh, how long.... <i>Until the end of time</i>, would be
saved and have their chance, their great chance, to become
<i>men</i>! How much they needed it, these black youth!
Only to see any daily, <i>every</i> daily paper, would answer
this! And how much would they appreciate it? Yes,
how much would they appreciate it?... And yet, what
did that matter?... Yes, there were plenty who would
say off-hand, "They would not know how to appreciate
it; they are incapable of appreciating it." ... But that
was from those who did not think deeply&mdash;and, yes, the
majority, by far, of this race to which he belonged, did
not think deeply. But Wilson Jacobs did. He had made
it a part of his young life to think deeply, and in the
interest of those who needed him.</p>

<p>And <i>now</i> they needed him. Oh, <i>how</i> much they needed
him, and how <i>much</i> strength he needed to raise twenty-seven
thousand dollars before midnight of December
thirty-first!</p>

<p>"Black people <i>do</i> appreciate that which is for their
good; but, <i>be merciful, dear God</i>, they know it not.
But they <i>will</i>, and when they <i>do</i> come to know it, how
<i>much</i> life, how <i>much</i> feeling and enthusiasm they will
exert! <i>And may we not say the same of all of us!</i>"</p>

<p>He had been a very young man when his country&mdash;yes,
<i>his</i> country&mdash;regardless of the fact that many of this
race now said, with pent up anger, "This is not <i>our</i>
country, it's the <i>white man's</i> country." How much
bitterness they put into the words, he could not soon
forget; but this <i>was his</i> country, and he proclaimed it
as such, and had enlisted and gone away to that little
island to the southeast.</p>

<p>He was with that cavalry; that cavalry of black men.
And when thousands of aimless bullets poured upon
America's greatest cavalry (commanded by the greatest
American citizen since one immortal one, who met his
death cruelly, but for <i>this</i> country), and tumbled them
from the saddles like so many playthings, he would never
forget that battle cry, "Onward boys!" And from
another direction, they came, <i>black men</i>. Up a hill that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
was forbidding in the abruptness of its ascent, they went.
Under the heavy fire of the enemy, they did not flinch.</p>

<p>What they did on that memorable day in our modern
history, the world knows. And if a part of our citizens
<i>did</i> not appreciate it at this date, one did. And he
proved it in after-years. So, when he heard these poor
men of his race now bemoan their fate, crying "This is
a white man's country. We have none!" he sighed, and
felt pity in his heart for them.</p>

<p>After the war, he had gone to Arizona, and spent one
summer there at a ranch during his vacation. And this
ranch was among the Navajo's. Dull, listless, inert
creatures they were. They did nothing to make this
country a better place in which to live, and they had
<i>never</i> done so, nor were they ever likely to. But, in
spite of that, they are the primitive inhabitants and
heroes; but not in the best sense, could anyone live
among those people three months and conscientiously
regard them as <i>men</i>. And yet they were given every
consideration, while black men were thrust aside. And
this was after three hundred years, out of which two
hundred and fifty were spent in developing that which
is called Dixie.</p>

<p>And, in spite of these conditions, Wilson Jacobs was
the most optimistic of all men. He conscientiously
believed that this was a black man's as well as a white
man's country. Yes, he heard those others say: "This
is a white man's country!" and they said it very loudly;
but these same men were the scions of those who had
tried, at the price of all their wealth and blood, to divide
it. He never let his memory dwell upon this. Other
black men did, though. So much so, that they made
themselves unfit for this new generation. What has
been done, he always considered could never be undone.
If prejudice against his people was the custom here,
prejudice against the Jew elsewhere, was usual also.
"But it isn't right!" they would deplore. And, of
course, he could only agree that it wasn't. To hate thy
brother, is contrary to the laws of Christianity, under
which we live.... But the prejudice remained after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
that could be said. "It's growing worse!" they cried.
"Yes, it appears to grow worse," he also agreed. "Then,
what have you to say?" And he answered: "Nothing!"
And then asked: "And you?" "Nothing!" "Then,
what are we to do? Become examples of dull inertia by
grieving over it, or shall we struggle to become <i>men</i>,
and through the strength of our mind and bodies, make
this a better place in which to live, if only for ourselves?
For live, we must. Not since the beginning of the world
have ten million souls sunk into oblivion." The pessimist
always departed at this point.</p>

<p>After all, Jacobs felt sorry and pitied both&mdash;the ones
who bemoaned their fate, and those who boasted.
Both were in error. For, regardless of what was said, he
loved America, his home and "<i>a man's country</i>"!</p>

<p>So, when college had given Wilson Jacobs his degree,
he drifted about for a year among his people. He had
never thought of the ministry as a vocation. And it
was only when he had seen his people as they were&mdash;not
altogether as they <i>ought</i> to be, did he appreciate the fact
that he might be able to help them. He had learned
while at school, but more in actual life, that Jesus lived
and died as a moral example. But his people saw only
the individual.</p>

<p>So back to school he had gone, where he studied five
long years, to fit himself for his present calling. His
success was yet to come. Mildred Latham had said <i>it
would come</i>. "Oh, Mildred! For you I would go through
eternity," he declared feverishly. But only the silent
walls answered him.</p>

<p>After many hours, he retired. The sun was shining,
although it was December, when he heard Constance
calling him to breakfast. How much he would have
liked to have said: "Constance, Mildred is somewhere
in this town, our Mildred! She is being persecuted,
Constance, our Mildred is being persecuted&mdash;being
hounded out of the sweet life we know she lived, and
inspired in those about her!" And he knew that Constance
would say: "Go forth, my brother, and find her;
bring her back into our home, that we may love her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
make her our sister, for it is as such she was, and more,
these many months." That was the spirit of the Jacobs.
But he kept his peace, and ate in silence.</p>

<p>Monday came, a cold, dreary day. Snow fell all over
the country, and Dixie land, far south, was white mantled.
Wilson Jacobs went to the depot, for he was
leaving on a great mission. Would he succeed? He
hoped so; others hoped so; and Constance hoped so,
as well as Mildred Latham.</p>

<p>But he never knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Please Stop&mdash;and Save Me!</i>"</p>


<p>"Breakfast is ready, my dear," said Mother Jane, for
as such she was known and called by all who knew her.
She was speaking to Mildred Latham.</p>

<p>A moment later, Mildred came out of her room and
seated herself at the table, at the head of which sat an
old gray-headed man, and at the foot sat Mother Jane,
whose head was white also.</p>

<p>"And did you rest well, my dear?" inquired Mother
Jane of Mildred, bestowing upon her a smile full of kindness
and tenderness.</p>

<p>"I slept beautifully," Mildred replied as kindly, and
beamed upon the old soul with all the consideration&mdash;maybe
more&mdash;of her own child.</p>

<p>"And you sell a book?" inquired the elder woman,
after a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I sell a book. A book by a young colored
author."</p>

<p>"By a young colored author? I do declare!" exclaimed
the other, with enthusiasm. "It is delightful
when I know we have young men who are doing something
else besides making convicts." Mother Jane was known
for her wit.</p>

<p>"What is the text of this story?" she inquired later.</p>

<p>Mildred told her.</p>

<p>"Delightful, to say the least." The elder woman had
secured some learning in her childhood, and had studied
by consistent reading, until she was well informed, and
used the most perfect English. "Went out into the great
west. To the <i>Rosebud Country</i>. Well, well. I read all
about that country when it was opened to settlers some
years ago. I wanted my son to go; but&mdash;he went elsewhere,"
and she paused to swallow, while a tear shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in her old eyes. Mildred spoke of other things. The
other didn't say, but quick intuition told her that son
had gone to the chain gang.</p>

<p>She had found this place two days after the visit that
was paid her by the unwelcome guest. It was far removed
from the black woman, and she was glad of it. And
yet, when she was taking her leave, that apparently evil
creature had shed tears and begged her to stay, saying
that she would not be molested further. Mildred felt a
human pity for her, but she knew she could not have
stayed on. The longer she lived, the more she was
learning that secrets are not good things to share with
others, or for others to be in possession of, regardless of
their good will thereto. She now knew that the only
way she would have people to know these things, people
she might chance to live with, would be to tell them
before she moved into the house. To have them find
out afterwards, and from others, would be, she felt, an
infringement upon their kindness. As for the man who
had, with his persistency, driven her from two places,
she hoped he would not succeed in finding her in the
present.</p>

<p>The following day, she went about her work with heavy
heart. She felt she must continue in the work as long as
she was in the city; and besides, she had accumulated
many orders for the holiday trade, and could, with her
efforts, secure many others. But it was not this alone
that held her in this city, it was something else.</p>

<p>She was following the effort of Wilson Jacobs to secure
the Y.M.C.A. Each week, she carefully noted the
details in regard to the same, and had fearfully observed
that it might fail. She was aware of the time limit,
and she was worried over the lack of the twenty-seven
thousand dollars. "How can he raise such a large
sum in so short a time?" she asked herself many times
each day. And yet she still hoped he would, even when
less than four weeks were left in which to do so.</p>

<p>She had managed, by dint of economy and hard work,
to accumulate almost two hundred dollars since she left
them, and this she would give at the right moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
when she saw there was any possible chance of his succeeding.
She would have to send it anonymously; but desire
for his success was her gravest concern.</p>

<p>Sunday came, and she stayed at home for the first
time since she came to the city. The sound of the bells
made her feel terribly sad and lonely. To have heard
Wilson Jacobs, or Reverend Castle, would have been a
privilege of which she would have been thankful to have
availed herself, but fear kept her confined to her room
all that day. She felt positive that he would visit all
the churches in search of her that day, and other Sundays.
So, with this pleasure denied her, she felt more
lonely now than she had ever felt before, since coming to
the city.</p>

<p>She purchased a book, a new novel, the evening before;
so in this she concentrated her mind all that day. It was
an unusual story, which made it more interesting. It
seemed that, in England, where the plot lay, a postmaster
was likely to be removed through subtle influences.
To save the position for him, because of her love, his
wife, who was all to him, made a sublime sacrifice. It
came to his attention, and in doing so, the fact of her
past was also revealed. It was a terrible book, to say
the least, but between the lines was a moral that the
reader was compelled to appreciate. In the end, the
man was redeemed to her through the church&mdash;the
Baptist church.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed without event. Her work went
along nicely, and she succeeded in delivering to almost
all of her holiday customers. It was about this time
that she became deeply concerned with regard to the
possibility of securing the Y.M.C.A. Wilson Jacobs
had not returned, nor had any word come from him, so
far as the public knew, as to whether he had met with
success. But Mildred entertained grave doubts regarding
the matter. If he were succeeding, it was her opinion,
that some word would be wired that cheer might fill the
hearts of the anxious ones waiting. She wished she
could go to Constance, and comfort her during these
anxious days. That desire became so uppermost in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
mind and heart, that it was with difficulty she kept herself
from rushing madly to the house, and throwing herself
to the other's feet. She felt strangely guilty. She
had convicted herself in their eyes, by fleeing. It couldn't
be changed now. No, she could not go to Constance,
as much as she wanted to. And, as she looked into it
deeper, she came to realize that she could never go to
Constance again.... That was the hardest part of it.
Never to go to her again. Oh, the anguish it gave her
when this was regarded as a reality.</p>

<p>"Constance," she prayed on her knees that night.
"Constance, will you, can you forgive me; can you
forgive Mildred? She loved you and your brother, and
it was because she was weak; because she felt that she
could never have stood to see both of you know&mdash;felt me
otherwise than as you knew me. Oh, I have suffered,
Constance; I have died a living death. Daily I long
for you; I pray in the only way I know how that he,
your brother, whom I know to be so strong, and noble
and good, may succeed in this great effort; this effort
which these others so much need. Some day, oh, Lord,
may it come to pass&mdash;though my mind cannot now see
it, I hope to feel that love again."</p>

<p>And then it came to pass, the next day she met the
other upon the streets, He smiled upon her through his
ugly teeth, and in soothing words, offered greeting. She
passed him by, but knew, without looking back, that he
followed. She had completed her work for that day.
Many copies of <i>his</i> book she had placed in other hands,
and that night many eyes would begin an acquaintance
with those years in the west. And now, at her heels
followed her vendetta. He would follow her to Mother
Jane's? And then she trembled. She could never allow
Mother Jane to even think she was any other but "her
dear daughter." For it was such Mother Jane now
called her. Anywhere now&mdash;but there.</p>

<p>She increased her steps, made them faster in a direction
that led to&mdash;she knew not where, nor cared; but anywhere
but to Mother Jane's. Supper would be awaiting
her there at six-thirty, as it had waited for her every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
these past weeks; but Mother Jane would be disappointed
this evening. Mildred Latham would not see
Mother Jane at that hour today, and maybe she, Mother
Jane, might never see "her daughter" again....</p>

<p>On she went. Before her, over a hill, came a car. She
could not catch that one, but others would come that
way soon. Maybe by the time she arrived beside the
tracks, another might meet her. She hurried. She
never looked back. She was too frightened. But intuition
told her that he followed. She wished she knew
how far he was in the rear. Maybe if the car came
before he arrived, she could elude him. Oh, if it would!
She was trotting now. She was so near the tracks at
this time, that they glistened like steel rays in the distance.
From a direction, which was not the way the
other car had come, she heard another car. It was
approaching, and now it flashed into sight.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared long ago, and the stars stood
out like a million diamonds in the skies above. The
evening air was chill, and she rushed&mdash;she was running
now&mdash;past the houses. The car was almost at the
crossing. Would she make it? She cried out and waved
her hand frantically. It was going to pass her, although
she had arrived at the crossing, and regarded it with eyes
that were frantic&mdash;wild! "Please stop, Mr. Motorman!"
she cried piteously.</p>

<p>"Please stop&mdash;and save me." It tore by her, the
front end. In the rear, she heard the crunch of feet
upon the gravel street. She saw the side of the car. It
dazzled her. She was lost. She could almost feel the
presence of the other. One terrible moment she swayed,
and the next, the rear end of the car was before her.
Welcome did the inside seem. She <i>must</i> catch that car,
she felt&mdash;<i>or die</i>. A brass rail touched her hand. Like
electricity, it closed over it. She was raised and then
felt her body speeding through space. A cry from the
inside and a "ting," then a shutting of brakes, and the
car came to a stop.</p>

<p>"My God," the conductor was saying, "why did she
grab that rail? This is the only line left with cars with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
the open entry. None of the others can be caught without
the consent of the conductor." She looked about
her. She sat in the rear of the car that was now speeding
into the business section. About her were many anxious
faces.</p>

<p>"Why, oh, why," their eyes and lips spoke, as soon as
they saw her, "did you take that terrible risk?" But
she did not see their eyes, or hear their words&mdash;for her
eyes were looking for another. He was not there.</p>

<p>And they never knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>What Her Eyes Saw</i></p>


<p>"Our daughter is late tonight, Gabriel," said Mother
Jane, coming from the door, where she had been many
times. "It is now almost seven, and she has not yet
arrived. I am uneasy. But I will be patient. Maybe
she had to wait on some of her customers. It is so near
the holidays, that some may have been downtown buying
presents for their friends, and she is compelled to wait.
Of course, she has never been late before, which doesn't
mean that she might not be late today&mdash;but, oh well,
I'll wait."</p>

<p>Gabriel, her old husband, played with his fork and
said nothing. He never said anything. He had not said
anything since '65. The rebels at Fort Pillar stopped
him from saying anything further, for since then he had
been speechless.</p>

<p>"We will have a big Christmas this year, Gabriel,"
said she. "Mildred's being with us will make a difference."
She was silent now, listening to the fire that
cracked in the grate. Presently her eyes sought a place
at the table. It was the place Mildred occupied, but she
was thinking of another. This other had been all to her,
for he was her son. Tears came to her eyes now, as she
thought of the years gone by, and the times she had
fixed that place for him. Yes, she had fixed the plate
there for him a thousand times. But he did not&mdash;had
not eaten from it for many a meal now. No, he ate
<i>elsewhere</i>. As she looked at the place today, strangely
she felt he would never eat there again. And he was
her only child. If he failed to carry the name beyond
his present circumstances, then the name of Gabriel
Ware ended with her mute husband, who sat waiting
patiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be so nice, Gabriel, to have her with us this
Christmas. And she stays right at home and reads to
us both every night. She is a sweet child, is Mildred.
She has been our own daughter since she came here.
It has been a treat for me, because I love so much to
read; while you have liked since '65 to hear me; but
my old eyes cannot follow the lines with the accuracy
they used to. No, the lines run together so often now,
and when they become clear again, it is so hard and tiresome
to find the place. But since she came, with her
young eyes, her cheerful smiles, her endless patience
with old people, who at the best are hard to get along
with, I appreciate that things have been so different."</p>

<p>Gabriel nodded. They lived easily, these two. This
may be a "white man's country," but our "Uncle"
took care of Gabriel and Mother Jane comfortably.
These many years, he gave to them many dollars at the
end of every quarter, and he had increased this, until
now Gabriel received ninety dollars four times a year.</p>

<p>A step sounded upon the porch. "There she is, God
bless her," said Mother Jane, and flew to the door,
opening it wide, and then, alas! No Mildred stood on
the threshold&mdash;but a man.</p>

<p>His teeth shown, and his hat in hand, he stood with
a bow, and inquired if Miss Mildred Latham was within.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the main street of the town, where all cars find
their way, Mildred alighted, and, crossing the street,
she waited for the car that would take her to the suburbs
which was near where Mother Jane lived.</p>

<p>When Gabriel and she had built and settled, it was far
from the town, and they had not dreamed, that some
day before they died, that their ten acres would be surrounded.
But the city grew, and they had sold the ten
acres long since, in lots for big prices. They had money,
she now knew, a part of which they had received for the
lots, and they owned other houses. But a part of what
they had was gone. It had been invested in a shoe
store, incorporated and conducted by colored people.
They knew not how colored people act in such capacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
so, in due time, they failed; therefore, going the way of
thousands of such attempts in Dixie. For, you see,
these black people had not known how to conduct such
a business. They only knew how to wear shoes, when
they were fitted by the other race.</p>

<p>"Now for home," Mildred sighed, as she settled back
and listened to the hum of the car, as it sped on its
way. "Oh, how glad I am that I eluded him," she
breathed happily. "I'll be late, which I dislike; but
it's better late than never. Blessed old dears," she
added, impulsively. And then fell to planning for the
Christmas day. It was so near now, that she would
have to hurry in her few plans. Months ago, she had
hoped she was going to spend a real, genuine, merry
Christmas with her friends, the Jacobs; but now, long
since, of course, she had given that up. But she was
glad that she had found this new place, and had been
there long enough to be so high in their favor, as to be
the star guest for their holiday.</p>

<p>They were industrious, and raised almost all they ate
in a garden of a half acre in the rear. And chickens!
Mother Jane had raised two hundred fifty. So they
had this meat almost every day. For supper they would
have some surely, so, soon she would eat, and then the
two would prepare for the coming event. She was impatient
to be there.</p>

<p>It was freezing outside. Ice could be seen from
the car window, gathering wherever there was water.
A nice hot fire they would have, she knew; while she
had a good new book that was half read through. After
all was done, she would read to them, and so all three
would be made happy.</p>

<p>She fell to thinking, to thinking of others, and Sidney
Wyeth came to her mind. Last Christmas she had
received two nice books from him. He wrote no letter,
nor did he autograph the same&mdash;he didn't even let her
know by word or letter that they were from him, but
she knew.</p>

<p>Where was he&mdash;where had he been since? She wished
she knew, for if she did, as she thought now, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
send him a nice book for a Christmas present. But he
would never know it was from her. Her pleasure would
be in the giving. That was why presents were given.
For the pleasure of giving a token of remembrance.
Some people did not consider it that way, but then they
were not Christians. She wondered, as the car sped
along, how many people who belonged to church did not
know they were not Christians.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew where he is," she said again, this time
half aloud. "Somehow I believe he would&mdash;forget&mdash;for
a day." And then she thought of Wilson Jacobs, and in
doing so, recalled that, in the months gone by, she had
seen him at the end of a talk, and was forced to look
away. She could not stand the pain in his eyes. Did
he care for her? She wouldn't trust herself to believe it.
It wouldn't be right. No. She was glad now that it
had gone no further. It wasn't right that he should be
allowed to do that, and then learn the truth. Oh, the
truth! That was <i>her</i> burden. The other had learned
the truth, and then he went away. He would never
return. No. And Wilson Jacobs would do likewise.
She had struggled these months to keep it from him.
If he learned from other lips, it would be as sad; but
she would at least not have to face him, and see another
suffering in his eyes. With Sidney Wyeth, it now seemed
different. As she had grown to feel, she believed she
could meet him. She felt now that if she could find his
whereabouts, she would go to him. Yes. She would go
to him and see him, and let him see her. Oh, as much
as she loved him&mdash;for her love had never died&mdash;she
believed now she could look in his eyes and ask him to
forget. She suddenly made up her mind to leave and
seek him. "But I can't," she moaned. "I can never
leave here until I know the worst in regard to the Y.M.C.A.
No. I would never be happy to leave them to
their fate until I know the best&mdash;or the worst." Somewhere
in the great north, Wilson Jacobs had either by
now, succeeded or failed. Which? Until she knew, she
couldn't bring herself to leave.</p>

<p>By this time, she had arrived at the getting off place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
She sprang lightly from the car, and walked briskly to
where a light shone, for one always shone from Mother
Jane's window. And it was this light which guided her
now. She skipped lightly along, humming a little song
as she did so. Again was she at peace with the world,
and forgave all who sinned against her. She had no
malice in her heart against anyone, as she approached
the house&mdash;the house of the Wares'&mdash;where already the
smell of nourishment was in the air.</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful it is to have a home. A place
where someone with love in their hearts awaits you, and,
when the door is opened, gathers you in welcome." She
thanked Him that is Holy, for being so kind to her.</p>

<p>She had arrived at last, and with a delightful sigh,
raised her foot to the step, and as she did so, her eyes
glanced through the window. The next moment she
fell back, and placed her hand upon her breast, while
her heart thumped violently within.</p>

<p>Then she turned, and disappeared into the night,
while those inside waited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_NINE_3" id="CHAPTER_NINE_3"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>Wha's Y' Man?</i>"</p>


<p>On she flew. Across the car tracks she stumbled, but
she didn't stop, nor did she look to see whether anyone
was coming or not. She thought of nothing, but to be
away, away, away! Down the street that was dark and
rough, and led to where she did not know, nor did she
even care. She was going away, away from everybody.
She would hide herself from the world. She could go to
another city, but there was no use in that either. She
cried half aloud as she hurried along: "I can stand it
no longer, I can stand it no longer! I want to die, oh,
I want to die!"</p>

<p>"I know," she choked at last, as she stumbled down
the middle of a dark alley, in which she now found herself.
"I know," she cried again. And she hurried on,
as soon as she had caught her breath. "It is the river.
Yes, the river." She quickened her pace as she came
into a street that was at the end of the alley. It was
wider. She hastened down a hill that seemed to her a
mile long, and maybe it was more. But when she had
hurried two blocks along this, she left the middle of the
street and took to the sidewalk, and slowed to a walk.
"I can't go on like this. It will excite people. I must
walk, but I must hurry, hurry, hurry!"</p>

<p>She had covered many blocks, when she came abreast
of buildings occupied by colored people. There was a
barber shop where men were being shaved, and a restaurant
where others were eating; a soda fountain also,
and she wondered whether the people who conducted it
made any money this time of the year.</p>

<p>The night seemed to have grown much colder, from
the frost that was on the windows, but Mildred Latham
did not feel it. Her face, she felt it for a moment, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
flushed. And then it occurred to her that her throat
was dry. Oh, yes. She knew why, now. She had cried
all the way from Mother Jane's to here&mdash;wherever it was.
And her face was hot, her throat was dry, and she wanted
water. She must have water, or she could no longer
swallow. For a moment she hesitated before the soda
fountain. Then she opened the door and entered. A
man who sat in the rear approached. He was a neat
man, with a heavy mustache. He invited her to a chair
at a table that was near a glowing fire. She took it.
He waited her order politely.</p>

<p>"I would like some&mdash;a-soda water, if you please," she
said hesitatingly. He looked at her a moment keenly,
winked his right eye, and then his left&mdash;then his right
eye again, twice. She looked at him without understanding.
He repeated it. She wondered what he
meant. Presently he moved behind the counter, and
returned with her order.</p>

<p>While she drank it, another, a woman came in. Mildred
watched him incidentally. He repeated the winking
process, while she glanced at the other, who repeated it.
He went now to a room in the rear, and when he returned,
he handed her something in a package. The woman
gave him a half dollar, and waited for no change.</p>

<p>"You're a stranger about here, Miss?" he said,
observing her a bit dubiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she replied, "I am a stranger about here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," he said, now gazing at her very keenly
a few moments. "You're one of the solicitors for the
Y.M.C.A., I suppose," said he, after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am not," she replied with a start, and
wondered why he asked her.</p>

<p>"They was a-planning t' have a meeting overhead
here t'night, was why I asked," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so," she commented, and then added:
"I am not connected with it in any way, but I am very
much interested in it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's too bad," he said thoughtfully, "but I
don't think we will ever get such a thing in this town.
It's going to be a failure, so I hear."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed," she echoed, "how so?"</p>

<p>"Well, unless they get twenty-seven thousand dollars
together in a week, it's sure to be. And 'f anybody c'n
raise that many dollars, 's hard's times is now, I'd lak
t' see them," he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>She wanted to ask him about Wilson, but hesitated.
Had he returned? He was speaking again:</p>

<p>"They ain't had no word frum the secretary since he
left. He went north some time ago, and it was hoped
that he might succeed in raising the amount among the
wealthy northern people. But it's dollars t' doughnuts
that he don't. 'Cause I figure it's lak this: 'f he'd a-had
any success up there, some word-a come back by now
frum 'im."</p>

<p>So no word had yet come from Wilson Jacobs, and as
she thought of his possible failure, all thought of herself
and what had been in her mind a moment ago, left her.
When she left the place she was calm. But where to
go now was another problem. To go back to Mother
Jane, never entered her mind. She wandered about for
an hour. She now recognized the locality. She was on
the same street she had found upon her arrival in the
city&mdash;Beal street. She walked up this for two blocks,
and where many Negroes were assembled. Several
picture shows greeted her, but she had no inclination for
such amusement.</p>

<p>Presently she turned into another street that led down
to the river. It was narrow and poorly lighted, and
the people, what few she saw, were ragged and dirty,
and forbidding. She walked some distance on this,
until she came across another that led in another direction.
Into this she turned aimlessly.</p>

<p>She had gone about three-quarters of a block, when
her eyes, in glancing up, caught sight of a house, dark
and weather beaten, with a glimmering light on the
front, under which was written:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Lodging For Men or Women<br />
rates right</span><br />
</p>

<p>She paused. Her hand touched her forehead; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
hot and throbbing. She felt tired, and her eyes were
heavy with sleep. She hesitated, turned into the gate,
and approached the door timidly. It was a forbidding
place, she saw as she came nearer. The door hung
weakly upon its hinges, while light came through the
many cracks. She shuddered. How different it was
from Mother Jane's, where everything was spick and
span, clean and well kept. Oh, if she could be home
now with Mother Jane! She wrapped lightly upon the
door, and it seemed a long time before someone shuffled
in that direction.</p>

<p>Presently, after a turning of bolts, or it seemed more
like someone was drawing a peg out of a staple, with a
squeak, the door opened about a foot. In the dim light,
the face of an old woman looked out from a very wrinkled
face.</p>

<p>"What d' ya want?" she asked gruffly.</p>

<p>"I see you have a sign up here," and she pointed
upward, "that says rooms," she replied, timidly.</p>

<p>"Yeh. Is yu 'lone. Wha's yu man?"</p>

<p>Mildred shuddered, and then she recovered. She was
tired and wanted to sleep. Tomorrow she would try to
do better. She replied as politely as she could; "I am
alone. I have no <i>man</i>."</p>

<p>"Hunh!" grunted the other, opening the squeaking
door wide as she said: "Come in!"</p>

<p>Mildred entered and stood looking about her, while
the old witch regarded her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"So you're alone, uh? Got no man. Hunh! That's
funny." She hobbled to where a lamp set, with chimney
smoked, and upon which a crack had been patched with
paper. "There's a chair. Sit down, gal." She shuffled
about, and when the light was better, by turning it up
a bit higher, she came near where Mildred sat, and
took a seat in an old rocker which had a sack filled with
straw, to make it more comfortable.</p>

<p>"How much do you charge for your rooms?" Mildred
inquired.</p>

<p>"Two bits when you're alone. Thirty-five cents if yu
got a man." Mildred had surmised that would be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
charge, and had the amount ready. She didn't care to
have this witch see that she had money. She handed
her the quarter. The old creature took it, held it to
the light, and examined it a moment before she dropped
it into an old pocket.</p>

<p>"Wantta go t' bed now?" the other inquired, a little
kinder than she had spoken before.</p>

<p>"I feel sleepy," said Mildred, and looked it.</p>

<p>"All right," said the other, rising with much difficulty.
"Ah, gal, that's rheumatiz. Bad. When you gits lak
dis, life don't hold much fo' you."</p>

<p>Mildred tried to look sympathetic as she followed her,
and murmured something inaudible.</p>

<p>They had entered a room now that corresponded with
the remainder of the house, except that the ceiling
seemed to be lower, and the room was a bit cleaner.
A small fireplace was in one side of the wall, and the
bed stood in an opposite corner. Two chairs, a table,
a bureau, a wash stand and a pitcher with a clean towel
spread over it, made up the meagre furnishings. A rag
carpet covered the floor.</p>

<p>"I don't fu'nish fiah," said the other, when she saw
Mildred's eyes rest for a moment upon the fireplace.
If there were a fire, she now felt she would rest better.</p>

<p>"I should like to purchase some fuel of you to make
a fire, if it is possible," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll sell you a nickel's wo'th."</p>

<p>"Very well. Bring it in." When the other was gone,
she took fifty cents in change from her purse. She
displayed this that the other might see and feel that
she possessed little. A few minutes later, she was alone
with a fire cracking in the grate, that soon made the
room quite comfortable.</p>

<p>She retired when the room had become warm. The
heat, in contrast with the air she had just come out of,
made her yawn. So, after barring the door securely,
she retired, and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>She might have slept for an hour, or it may have
been only a minute, but she was slowly awakened by a
stream of light that poured in through the window. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
sat up suddenly, and blinked as the rays fell across her
face, and saw that she had forgotten to draw the blind
and that the moonlight was streaming into her room.</p>

<p>But it was not that alone which had awakened her.
There was some commotion in the street, or rather, in
the house next door. A wagon stood at the front, and
into it, policemen were pushing men and women. The
wagon was a police patrol, and they were making a raid.
In a few minutes it was all over, and, dropping back,
she was soon asleep again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TEN_3" id="CHAPTER_TEN_3"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>Kick Higher Dare, Gal!</i>"</p>


<p>Christmas day had come and the whole country was
gay and festive. In the city of our story, the sun shone
beautifully, and from the way the birds sang, it was
hard to believe it was late December. The streets, at
an early hour, were filled with pedestrians seeking the
open air, freedom and merriment. Fire crackers filled
the air with noise; while the discharge of blank cartridges
and an occasional gunshot, as well as a cannon now and
then, added to the confusion. The sharp noises made
many people start suddenly, and then smile when they
recalled that it was Xmas day; the day when Jesus,
our Saviour, came into the world, and began a Christian
civilization.</p>

<p>But there was one person who was neither gay, merry,
nor festive; although she had cherished hopes, dreams,
and desires for that day.</p>

<p>Mildred Latham lurked in the confines of the room
she had taken, seeing the world&mdash;a small part of it&mdash;from
the window of the room she had taken a night or two
before. She had remained in it ever since, venturing
out only to get something to eat and drink. She was
almost oblivious to the fact, that it was Xmas day,
until the discharge of firearms and crackers came to her
ears from the street. And then she awakened to the
reality of what she would lose that day.</p>

<p>A Chinaman ran the restaurant where she bought her
meals. At one of their stores, she had purchased a few
dishes and a knife, spoon and a fork, so she brought the
meals to her room, and ate the same at the table. She
had no plans now for Xmas day. She tried to forget it,
but the noise from the street did not permit her to do
so. As the sun rose higher, the revelry became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
pronounced. She tried to forget the day Mother Jane
and she had planned to spend together. She tried to
shut out of her mind the day she might have spent with
the Jacobs. And she tried, likewise, not to see the
dreary day she must now perforce spend&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher and higher, and the day became
warmer. So warm about noon, that she raised her
window and permitted the soft breeze to float in upon
her, filling her lungs with it, and sighing contentedly.
She watched the few people that passed that way, and
noted that they all appeared so happy. They were all
apparently carefree and desirous of getting all the
enjoyment that the day afforded. Presently it occurred
to her to venture forth and get something. It was bad
enough that she must spend it alone; but to hover in
the four walls of that little room, was a fact she could
no longer submit to.</p>

<p>She passed into the room that may have been called
a sitting room, and where the old woman was stewing
some meat on the rusty stove. Before the other turned
at the sound of her footfall, she scrutinized her for a
moment, meditatively. She wondered who this old
woman was, who lived thus alone. She fancied what her
life must be; she had other roomers, she had observed;
but they came in late and left early, so she had no idea
who they were, or what kind of people stayed there.
She hesitated for a second, and then the other turned and
faced her.</p>

<p>"Uh, gal," she creaked in her shaky old voice, "be
goin' out t' see a li'l' Xmas, ha, ha! Sho' you might.
Cain' stay shut up in that room all time!" And she
grinned, which made her features repulsive to Mildred.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I thought I would step out and look
around a while," she answered kindly. "I shall be
back presently."</p>

<p>As she went toward the gate, the hag looked after her
and shook her head, as she muttered: "That gal's a
puzzle, a devilish puzzle. I cain' make her out; but of
one thing I'm certain, she's straight. Huh! Yes, she's
straight," and she continued shaking her head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was that fact that made her a mystery to this
old woman.</p>

<p>She walked along slowly when she got into the
street, looking from one side to the other. At the end
of the street, in the direction she had taken, was the
warehouse district. In the old days, this had been a
prominent shipping point by water; but now this had
been largely substituted by railroads. The yards were
quiet today, as she made her way along, while scarcely a
wagon was in evidence around the many large buildings.</p>

<p>She walked in the same direction until she came to a
street that led down to the river. She turned into this,
and followed it until she stood on the banks of the stream
that flowed gently southward. It was filled with a
number of boats, while ferries plied back and forth to
the other side. For a half hour she stood thus, with her
mind free of all care, and enjoyed the stiff air that came
with the breeze from the river. When she presently
turned to go, she felt strangely invigorated, and decided
to walk about more.</p>

<p>Without regard to direction, she finally found herself
on Beal street, which she recognized at once. She paused
briefly before venturing into it, but the street was filled
with music; while across the way, several electric shows
invited the crowds that poured in and out. So she went
forward timidly. She stopped at length before a black
boy who was turning a street piano. The music was
exhilarating, and she gave him a nickel when he was
starting away, whereupon he dropped the handles and
played her three of the popular airs. She gave him
another nickel, and he took delight in turning on three
more. By this time a crowd had gathered, and, thinking
quickly, she slipped away and continued her way.</p>

<p>She stood before a large picture show for colored people
a few minutes later. At the front were gorgeous pictures,
advertising the show within. She hesitated briefly, and
then, fishing a five cent piece from her purse, she entered
the show, and took a seat to one side. In a minute her
attention was centered on the screen, where a western
play in which red Indians and cowboys were in a mimic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
battle was being shown. The play aroused much interest
in the audience, which fairly raised from the seats at
times, especially when there was a gun play; and since
gun playing seemed to be in evidence, much excitement
was attendant during the whole time the reel was being
run.</p>

<p>She recalled suddenly, what she had read in the book
of Sidney Wyeth, with regard to Indians. He had dwelt
at some length upon this subject, and had concluded a
chapter with words to the effect that the Indian, as he
was today, and had been for years, was in no wise what
he was pictured upon the screen, or in novels, but a shiftless
being, without spirit. In truth, only an example of
dull inertia.</p>

<p>The next reel was much more original, she thought,
and, therefore, more interesting&mdash;to her; but it wasn't
to many of those about her, who, as she heard them,
made little effort to catch the moral of it.</p>

<p>It was a play of present day life, in which the hero
was a man employed as floor walker in a large department
store, while the heroine was a girl, employed in the
most insignificant position in the basement of the same.
She studied the play, and was carried away with the great
human interest conveyed in the plot. It was a difficult
task to keep her mind and thoughts upon it, however,
because all about her, many remarks came from impatient
creatures, who continually muttered aloud,
demanding that it be hurried off, and something with
"ginger" put on.</p>

<p>"Hu'y, hu'y, 'n' git hit off! Git a gal out the' 'n'
some song 'n' dancin'," said one who sat next to her,
and who, she observed, was ragged and dirty in the
bargain; his long, kinky hair stood erect on his head,
and made him resemble something recently departed
from the jungle.</p>

<p>When the vaudeville in connection therewith was put
on, she was filled with disgust. It was not refined vaudeville,
and in no way corresponded with the pictures that
had preceeded it; but of the most vulgar sort. It brought
shrill cries from the throats of those about her, and
remarks that showed the character of the crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put the sof' pedal on it, kid, ke-ha!"</p>

<p>"Dat gal sho kin' sing, nigga, believe muh!"</p>

<p>"Kick higher, dare, gal! You ain' done nothin',"
growled one, who was not satisfied.</p>

<p>Mildred arose to go out. To get to the aisle, she must
pass about ten people, mostly men in rough clothing.
"Set down, gal, don' git in front-a me!" one next to her
complained.</p>

<p>"Don' spile my gaze when dat gal's showing up lak
she is," said another. With a sigh and a disgusted feeling,
she sank back and made herself patient, until the
disgusting performance was at an end. She had no
trouble then, for all those between her and the aisle
filed out ahead of her. Apparently they came to the
show for the purpose of witnessing the vaudeville only.</p>

<p>When she was on the street again, the sun was getting
toward the west, but she did not feel like going back to
the hovel she called a room yet. The noise and music
seemed to make her forget her troubles and worries, and,
mingling with the masses that now filled the sidewalks,
she followed them aimlessly along the street. She
stopped before other shows, and, when, at last, finding
one that appeared to have no vaudeville in connection
with the pictures, and which did not appear to have
such a big crowd about the entrance, she entered and
took a seat toward the rear.</p>

<p>She had been seated about half an hour, when she
chanced, upon looking back, to see someone whose face
was familiar. She looked toward the front, and then,
after a few minutes, in which she tried to recall where
it was she had seen it before, she turned her head slowly,
and looked again. Behind her, and just seating themselves,
were not only three women belonging to Wilson
Jacobs' church, and with whom she was well acquainted&mdash;they
had been her best friends, and had admired her
playing and singing&mdash;but in their midst, sat Constance
herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>My Wife&mdash;Sick&mdash;HELL!</i>"</p>


<p>It was the day before New Years, and the city was in the
grip of a severe blizzard that has swept down from the
northwest, and had driven the people from the streets and
into their homes, where they stayed closely shut in.
From her little room, Mildred Latham peeped out
through the small window, and was glad it was an ugly
day without; for, being so, she did not feel as lonesome,
and so desirous of going forth, as she had the few days
previous; or, since Xmas day.</p>

<p>She would never forget the moments she went through,
wondering how she would extricate herself, when her
friends entered the show and seated themselves behind
her.</p>

<p>She had sat with her heart beating a tattoo against
her ribs, and hardly dared to breathe. The play was a
deep one that flashed upon the screen, but her attention
had wandered. She was trying, with all her senses, to
think of some way out, and the way would have to
come quickly, for if not, at the best, it would be only a
question of minutes, possibly seconds, before one of the
trio saw and recognized her. She was almost choking
when there was a noise in the rear. All eyes turned
quickly, and then there was a snapping of films, or
something; but, whatever it was, the place was dark in
a moment.</p>

<p>Now was her chance, she thought, as the theater was
suddenly plunged into darkness. She arose. Could she
make it? In a flash the lights might be on. "Great
God!" she trembled. "Suppose they should be turned
on!" And with this fear gripping her heart until the
perspiration started, she struggled toward the door.
She stepped on many toes, while growls and complaints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
came from the lips of the owners, but she felt her way
resolutely forward and toward the aisle. It seemed like
an age before her feet found it. Through the place now,
matches were flashing. She glanced for a brief second in
the direction of those from whom she was fleeing, and,
as she did so, someone struck a match. In that moment,
the faces of the four came full into view. "Oh, my God!"
she cried inaudibly, "they are looking straight at me."
But before the flare had died, she breathed a sigh of
relief, for, at that moment the lights came on, and they
were looking toward the screen.</p>

<p>She passed quietly out, and, when once outside, hurried
in the direction of her room.</p>

<p>They had not seen her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day was fading into twilight. The sun had set,
and with it the wind had fallen; the air had become
still, and the stars shone brightly from above.</p>

<p>"If I don't get out of this place for an hour, I will
surely die," cried Mildred, walking the floor in a fit of
impatience. Having become accustomed to plenty of
exercise, the days that had come and gone since Xmas
day had seemed like an eternity. Perhaps it was hard
for her, because she had not been further than the restaurant
since that day. She admitted to herself that she
was afraid to go anywhere now. She had not the courage
to run the risk of being seen again, and had, therefore,
remained confined to her room.</p>

<p>She paused before the window, and looked long and
earnestly into the street. Never before had anything
seemed so inviting. She was simply mad to be in it, if
for only a half hour; but to be in it, she felt she must.
After a time, she resolved to run the risk. She fixed
herself as best she could, and shuddered when she realized
that she had not changed her clothes for a week. At
last, with a suppression of her excited nerves, she slipped
out of the house, and entered the street just as darkness
had set in, and the stars were the brightest.</p>

<p>She hurried along, and when she had arrived at the
end of the street, she turned into another, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
direction she had not been before. Along this she hurried,
feeling the sting of the air, which brought the blood
to her cheeks, and made her feel real life, after many
days of fear and worry. She had been downtown one
day before Xmas, where she dispatched a telegram, and
now, as she hurried along, it occurred to her to go to the
office again. She walked boldly in that direction, and
a moment after she had entered, she came out with a
satisfied smile playing about the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Now," she whispered softly, "where shall I go?"
Without answering her own question, she began walking.
She walked until she had exercised her limbs, and they
were tired. So she felt like sitting down and resting.
Still she continued the way she was going until, in turning
a corner, she ran fully into someone and fell back
with: "I beg your pardon!" And then suddenly the
other fell back.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Latham!" the other exclaimed, amazed.</p>

<p>"Miss Jones, I declare!" echoed the other, and stood
abashed.</p>

<p>"I have not seen or heard of you for months. Indeed,
I thought you left town long since!"</p>

<p>"No-o," Mildred mumbled, frightened and embarrassed,
all in one.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what&mdash;what are you doing&mdash;in <i>this</i> part of
town!" the other exclaimed, now regarding her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> part of town?" she echoed bewilderingly.
"I&mdash;I&mdash;don't understand. <i>Why</i> this part of town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>this</i> part of town." She paused a moment and
surveyed Mildred in wonder, and then went on: "Why,
didn't you know? <i>This</i> part of town&mdash;is the <i>restricted
district</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Miss Jones!" she wailed. "Heaven help me!
I didn't know!"</p>

<p>The other looked at her keenly and a little dubious,
and then she said, with a toss of her head, as something
seemed to have occurred to her when the other looked at
her strangely:</p>

<p>"I guess you wonder <i>what I</i> am doing down here, too."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>The other started, and her lips opened to say she had
not, but before she could say anything, the other continued:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind admitting what <i>I</i> am doing down
here, since I see <i>you</i> here, also; but I have been coming
down here for a long time. Yes, you see this is not
the first time. I have been down here before," and she
laughed a hard laugh, as she ended with another toss
of her head.</p>

<p>Mildred stood frozen. She could not collect her
shattered wits to say anything, but she was thinking.
Miss Jones was a member of Wilson Jacobs' church and
sang in the choir. "It can't be possible!" she murmured
inaudibly. "It can't be possible!" And then,
all of a sudden, she felt sorry for Miss Jones, because she
had liked her, and thought her very sweet. And now
she met her face to face <i>in the worst</i> part of the city!
How could this be explained! Miss Jones being encountered
in the <i>worst part</i> of the city!... And Miss
Jones had, with her own lips, admitted that 'she had
been there before. <i>She had been coming there for a long
time.</i>' "Oh, God," Mildred cried almost aloud: "This is
terrible!" <i>Why</i> did Miss Jones come to this part of
town?... Miss Jones came to this part of town and
<i>knew</i> she was doing so.... Then, if that were true&mdash;which
it surely was&mdash;Miss Jones was <i>a bad girl</i>.... Miss Jones
a <i>bad girl</i>? She could not believe it; and yet, before
she could get all this through her whirling brain, she
heard Miss Jones speaking again. What was she saying?
It couldn't be true! Surely Miss Jones could not mean
what she was saying. Oh, horrors! If Miss Jones
meant what she was saying, then, Miss Jones regarded
her as a <i>bad girl</i>, too. "Miss Jones, Miss Jones!" Something
in her now was crying, although her lips moved not.
"Please don't, please don't! I am not that way.
I am not a <i>bad girl</i>, oh, no, please, <i>please</i>!" And still
her lips had not moved. She stood like a dumb person;
but she heard Miss Jones clearly:</p>

<p>"Let's go over here to a place <i>I know</i>," she said. "It's
safe&mdash;nobody but a swell bunch goes there, no tramps
or <i>talkers</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt all she had heard a moment before now running
through her mind, and yet she did not speak. Miss
Jones was speaking again:</p>

<p>"We are both in the same boat; one's as <i>bad</i> as the
other. No questions asked...."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Jones," Mildred heard again, but her lips
still were not moved. "How can you, oh, how can you!"
Why <i>didn't</i> she do something? She heard herself, but
words were not spoken: "Why <i>do</i> you stand, Mildred
Latham? Why do you not go&mdash;<i>hurry</i>? You have stood
<i>too</i> long now. Hurry, hurry! To Mother Jane's&mdash;to
Jacobs! Yes, to anywhere; but go, go, go!" And still
she stood in flesh, and made no reply.</p>

<p>"A swell bunch from the north, railroad fellows with
plenty of coin. Some good time, kid. Come on at once.
Let's don't stand here and be looked at."</p>

<p>She was in a trance now. She couldn't stand there;
she was aware of that. That would be worse. How to
get out, she did not know, for she had now forgotten
how she came in. But she had no notion of following
Miss Jones. No. She would go to Mother Jane's&mdash;no,
she would go to Jacobs. Jacobs? <i>Who</i> were they? Oh,
yes. She remembered now. And when she knew the
Jacobs, she had known them for <i>the truth</i>. If she went
to them and told them she had just came from the&mdash;&mdash;oh,
no, no, no! She couldn't go to Jacobs.... But now
she had it. She would go to Sidney Wyeth.... Yes,
that was where she would go. He would welcome her.
He would be good to her; while she&mdash;she&mdash;<i>would tell
him everything</i>&mdash;yes, <i>everything</i>. Oh, she was glad she
had thought of him in time. Because if she had waited
a little longer, she <i>might not be fit</i> to go to him.</p>

<p>They were going now, Miss Jones and she. Miss
Jones was going, where? She didn't know, but she,
Mildred Latham was going to her lover, Sidney Wyeth.
Oh, how she loved him&mdash;she had always loved him;
but now she loved him more than ever. And she was
going to him, and when she arrived, the first thing she
would do, would be to get on her knees, as she did when
a little girl, at her prayers. She would tell him all. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the truth from the time she was old enough to remember,
until today. Yes, she would tell <i>him all</i>. She
would show him how faithfully she had worked in the
sale of his book. And she would tell him how she had
been driven from place to place, until she had no home
nor friends; but, withal, she had remained clean. <i>Clean?</i>
Yes, that was why she had struggled so. She had fought
<i>everything</i>, to keep clean.... And he, oh, he&mdash;would be
happy. Oh, he would be <i>so</i> happy. And then they
would both&mdash;yes, <i>both</i> go to the <i>Rosebud Country</i> together.
Wouldn't that be delightful? They would go
to the <i>Rosebud Country</i> together and live happily.</p>

<p>"Here we are," she heard Miss Jones saying. She
rapped on the door in a peculiar fashion. Presently the
door opened, but no one stood beside it or behind it.
It had opened from the top of a stair, which they mounted
the moment they entered. This led to somewhere, but
she followed.</p>

<p>Now they were at the top, and paused for a brief
moment; then, turning to the right, they crossed a
hallway and entered a room. The door closed behind
them, and it was some time before her eyes became
accustomed to the darkness within. <i>Why</i> was the room
dark? She wondered; but just then it became a blaze
of light. She looked all around her bewilderingly. It
was a beautifully furnished room, with a soft, heavy
carpet, while about the room were many heavy chairs.
In the center was a table, and around the side were smaller
tables. "What was this place?" she asked herself,
feeling the back of one of the heavy chairs. To one side
of the room was a huge buffet with a number of glasses,
all thin and of many varying sizes, artistically arranged.
On the other end was a piano, with an electric cord
reaching it from above. And as she stood looking at it,
a light within it flashed, and it began to play a song
that made the room resound.</p>

<p>"Hark! What was that!" she cried, with her lips
closed. She saw the eyes of her companion, as her ears
listened to the music. A smile, a wild smile danced in
the eyes of Miss Jones. She caught Mildred suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
about the waist, and before she was aware of it, was
whirling her about in a waltz. And the tune&mdash;was the
<i>Blue Danube</i>!</p>

<p>In the midst of the sweet old tune, the door they had
entered a moment ago swung open, and two men entered.
They were striking looking men and were dressed in the
latest style of clothes. They were both smoking cigars,
and the room was soon filled with the aroma. But they
must have been good cigars, because the odor they gave
off was pleasant&mdash;so Mildred thought.</p>

<p>Miss Jones dropped her at once and flew to one of them,
who gathered her in his arms, and dreadful, before the
others he kissed her. As Mildred swallowed, she turned
and nestled in his embrace, and with his hands he pulled
her head back until her round throat stood out beautifully,
and kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>Mildred was shocked at such immodesty; but before
she got over it, the other stood over her, smiling down
into her face with eyes that danced like fire. She fell
away from beneath his amorous gaze, and ran across the
room and got behind a chair. She turned and looked at
him wildly now. He hurried after her. His lips were
pursed to say something funny, and then he saw her
eyes. He stopped suddenly and fell back a step, while
his smile died and his gaze, as he saw her now, grew
pointed.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" he muttered slowly. The others disembraced
themselves, and regarded them for a moment.
They looked from one to the other, and then three pairs
of eyes rested upon her alone. At first they were dubious,
and then, as they saw the frightened look, they changed
to something akin to contempt.</p>

<p>"Aw, kid," cried Miss Jones&mdash;and Mildred had never
imagined she could be so coarse. "'Cut' it. He's a <i>good</i>
guy, he is. A <i>thoroughbred</i>!" She looked at the man
now, who appeared a trifle angry. "You're spoiling it
all. He'd <i>like</i> you; but he don't want too much of the
kid play."</p>

<p>"These good lookers are always hard t' land," said
the man. "But this trick appears the hardest." Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
to her he said: "Come on kid. Look over my hurry of
a moment ago. That face of yours, I must say, got me
'daffy'," and he laughed with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>Her tension relaxed, and she permitted herself to come
from behind the chair. A moment later they were seated
around the large table in the center of the room. A
waiter now stood over them, with eyes askance.</p>

<p>"Little Sunny Brook'll do me," said one of the men.
The other nodded the same; his eyes rested upon Miss
Jones, who tossed her head gayly, and said:</p>

<p>"Aw, Dickie and Joe, I don't like it straight. Make
mine a dry martini."</p>

<p>He attended Mildred now, while the others conversed.
She did not know what to say. She had not thought of
anything to drink; but in that moment she knew she
would have to order something.</p>

<p>"A coca cola," she said quietly.</p>

<p>Three pair of eyes regarded her then with surprise
evident. As it became clear to them, all threw their
heads back and laughed loudly. The waiter stood with
a little smile about the corners of his mouth, which
showed he possessed a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Mildred was silent and looked at them in surprise.
Presently, when they had quieted, Miss Jones said a
little impatiently:</p>

<p>"You're a good one, kid. I must say so. Coca cola!
ha, ha! But they don't carry coca cola at this 'joint',"
whereupon they laughed again.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," now spoke the waiter. "We carry <i>coca
cola</i>, but it's used as a wash." They laughed long and
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Bring us a quart of Sunny Brook," said the man who
was nearest her. "And&mdash;yes, bring this little girl here
a coca cola&mdash;for a wash."</p>

<p>He lit a fresh cigar, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Play cards, kid?" he inquired, and looked at her.
"Why don't you say something, sweetness? Gee! Has
the cat got your tongue?" he complained a trifle nervously,
as he flicked the ashes from the cigar.</p>

<p>The waiter had returned now with many glasses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
bottles, and their drinks were before them. Before her
was placed a small bottle of the drink she had ordered,
while two glasses were arranged beside it, while a
larger glass filled with ice stood beside them. The
others had before them likewise, all except Miss Jones,
whose drink was in a peculiar glass with a long stem,
and flashed green in the electric light.</p>

<p>The others poured their glasses about half full, while
Mildred poured a part of the fluid in one of the glasses
before her. It foamed! She stopped, and when it quit
foaming, the glass was only about a third full. She had
not observed how much it lacked of being full, when
suddenly the room resounded with the music of the
electric piano. It took her so much by surprise, that she
turned quickly and looked. When she saw that it was
only the piano, she turned to them again, as they raised
their glasses. She took up hers, at a sign from them.
It was full. They all drank together.</p>

<p>She had a mighty effort to swallow hers. When she
had succeeded, she made a wry face, and tasted the stuff
gingerly. She had never drunk coca cola that tasted
like that before. The others smiled naively. She felt
strange. She raised her hands to her head. It felt
stranger still. She wondered at such a strange feeling
after a drink of something she was fond of? She had
drunk as many as a half dozen bottles a day, and as
many as three bottles in an hour. But three bottles
had never any effect; while now, her head was whirling
terribly. Everything about her swam. She saw the
others smiling, and then she heard herself talking and
laughing; but she was not aware of what she was saying.</p>

<p>It was perhaps an hour later, or it might have been
only a half, but she was on the street. She was trying
to walk, but apparently she was not succeeding, for the
man she had run from was supporting her. He had his
arm about her waist; while his free hand held both of
hers. She was not talking now. She was resting. Her
neck was limp. Presently they turned into another
place. She did not know where. Before them raised
another flight of stairs, and up this they walked&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
he did and almost carried her. A full minute it took
before they reached the top. An old woman met them.
Mildred saw her for a brief moment, and recalled that
she resembled the one where she had a room.</p>

<p>"My wife is sick," she heard the man say, "is sick.
I wish to get a room."</p>

<p>"His wife?" she repeated, but that was all. Darkness
was all about her now; but the man repeated his
words, and at the same time handed the old woman a
half dollar. A moment later a door closed behind them,
and the next a key turned.</p>

<p>But Mildred Latham didn't hear it.</p>

<p>The old woman looked after them a moment, as she
rubbed the new coin in her palm. She raised it to her
lips and kissed it with a smack. She regarded the door
of the room in which they had disappeared, and then
she burst into a fit of laughing.</p>

<p>"My wife&mdash;sick&mdash;<i>Hell!</i>" And went about her duties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs sat in his study, gazing across the room
at a clock. It "tick-tocked" as it always had. The
minute hand slipped from notch to notch. There was
nothing whatever wrong with it. It was a good clock.
As he gazed at it, he recalled that in the years it had
stuck to the wall there, it had never stopped; it had
never varied from standard city time more than a minute
or two during those years. And yet he watched the
clock as though it were something strange; something
uncanny; something that spelled his end.</p>

<p>For it was, and it marked the failure of his great
effort.</p>

<p>In a few hours now that clock would show another
year, for it was the night of December thirty-first.</p>

<p>In a few hours, it would tell him, as it had told him
before, that a new year had come. Yes. But this year
it would tell him more. How much more? It was hard
to estimate. He made no effort to do so. He had already
done that in the past few days&mdash;the days he would
always remember as the darkest in his life of hope.</p>

<p>A noise in the other room came to his ears. It was a
sigh. It was Constance, and he was sorry for her. Yes,
Constance had hoped until the last minute that he
would succeed. But he had failed....</p>

<p>Vainly he struggled in the great northeast, to secure
those thousands to complete the amount necessary. He
had gone from town to town. The people were kind;
they were considerate, and they listened patiently;
while he waxed eloquent and forceful in his appeal for
this great purpose. He met the nicest people he had
ever met&mdash;he knew that. So refined, and how much
they appreciated his great cause, was shown in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
town, large or small. They took him through many of
the buildings. They were perfect pictures, and the
management was the best. The per cent of people who
could not read or write in those parts, did not include
any of the native born. He had never, he recalled this
now strangely, met people who were so courteous. He
had been so long in Dixie, and, therefore, accustomed to
the country there, that he found it hard to believe that
white people could be so courteous to a Negro. True,
but they held to their money. They shook their heads
and pointed across the water&mdash;and he knew.</p>

<p>He had raised less than three thousand dollars. He
lacked almost twenty-five thousand of having the proper
amount when he returned home.</p>

<p>His sister met him with a kiss. She looked hopefully
into his eyes at the same moment, and knew he had
failed. So they had said nothing about it. Others came
in as soon as they learned he had returned, and it was
with a heavy heart that he told them the result.</p>

<p>"Well," said the professor of the colored high school,
"you made a brave fight, Reverend. Yes, you made a
brave fight. More than ten thousand dollars in such a
short time is going some. You beat Grantville by twice
the amount, and did it in one-third the time."</p>

<p>"By the way, Doctor," said a mail clerk, as he was
passing out. He stopped, and lighting a cigar, continued:
"What ever became of that young lady who played at
the church, and who started the cash subscription?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the professor, "I have intended to ask
you myself."</p>

<p>"My friends," said Wilson, "it is the strangest thing
I ever knew; but we have not seen that young lady
since the day you were here&mdash;in fact, we have not seen
her since she left the church that Sunday."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" both exclaimed. "That is strange!"</p>

<p>"The strangest thing, I should say," he declared.
They spoke of it at some length, and then they took
their leave. Others had come, and made it harder for
him to tell. Words of consolation were given by all,
which made it still harder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>He arose after a time, and walked back and forth across
the room. He thought of the Y.M.C.A. in a northern
city for colored men, and where he had stopped. Such
a delightful place it had been. There was a pool hall,
a cafe, a barber shop, a complete gymnasium, a swimming
pool, a reading room with piles of the latest magazines;
in fact, there was everything to keep young men out of
bad company, and, at the same time, provided for them
a place for clean, manly sport. He had stopped there
three days, and during that time he had observed the
great good it was doing the young Negro men of that
city. The Negro population was not one-fourth that of
this town, and still the schools there were the best;
while almost everything in the way of public conveniences
was open to the black people. If the Y.M.C.A.
could be of such great good in a community of that
sort, words, figures, estimates, all were inadequate to
describe what a great benefit it would be to this town.</p>

<p>And, until the last day he did not despair. He hoped
and he worked. "The administration has balled the
financial situation up so badly, that it is useless to seek
subscriptions for anything," one had told him.</p>

<p>"A million and more dollars he has given away," said
the secretary of a millionaire he had consulted. "Yes,
I will arrange an appointment," but from the way he
said it, he was sure it would do no good.</p>

<p>"Crime and evil environments have undermined the
foundations of our society; those people, for whom a
million men went to battle fifty years ago and freed,
have reached a place in our American society, where it is
the greatest mistake of a decade that they are not provided
with better surroundings." He said this time and
again, and the people heard him through, but in the
end it was the same.</p>

<p>By some he was greatly encouraged. If the gift of the
Jew could be extended a year, all would be well, he was
sure; but that had been settled.</p>

<p>"I am asking you for assistance, because we have at
our disposal three-fourths of the amount necessary;
but, without your assistance in this, this three-fourths
reverts back to those who have offered it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>"The country is in a bad shape," and they pointed
again across the water.</p>

<p>And now he had returned, and had to admit to himself
and the others that he had failed. He forgot his own
desire; he wanted the association for the great good it
would do his people.</p>

<p>He seated himself, and mechanically his eyes sought
the clock again. It tick-tocked the minutes away, and
the minutes became hours, and every hour drew him
near the end. If he could present twenty-five thousand
dollars to the Y.M.C.A. by twelve o'clock that night,
it would be saved.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him to go into the street and
walk about for a time. Maybe he could forget it. He
picked up his hat, that he had thrown on the floor in his
absentmindedness, and drawing on his overcoat, made
his way thither. It was a crisp night, and the chill, as
he struck the street, made him quicken his steps, and he
walked briskly in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>He observed with a start, presently, that he was going
in the same direction and the same street, he had taken
before going north. The incident and the words he had
overheard came back to him, and he thought of Mildred
with a pang of the heart. "I wish I could see her now,"
he said; and then, in the next breath, he said no. "I
would have to tell her that I had failed, after her kind
words. She said I would succeed. Yes, she said that&mdash;and
meant it." He walked on, and finally fell to talking
to himself aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes, Wilson Jacobs, with all you have been through,
you have come to this in the end. You've failed." And
then something somewhere in his mind said: "Yes, you
have failed, but don't despair. All may not be lost.
As long as there is life, there is hope." He laughed at
this, and wondered then at the strange caprice of the
human brain. "Wonderful," he commented. "I wonder
how did man ever come to be. In the years when he was
wild, that was different. But now he is becoming so
wise, that almost miracles are accomplished. He continues
to grow wiser as the years go by, until I wonder
what it will all come to in the end."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>By now he had reached the place where he overheard
the voices of a few weeks before. It was dark. Not a
soul nor a sound came from within. He stood where he
had heard the voices, but no voices came to him that
night. He presently retraced his footsteps. He could,
at least, be home and comfort his sister. She could not
be allowed to be alone while the old year died and the
new sprang into being. He dragged himself along in an
aimless fashion, not hurrying. As he figured in his
mind, he had yet two hours.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the house and entered, he resumed
his seat in the study, and, since there was nothing else
to do, he resumed his task of watching the clock. Not
as much time was left as he thought for. It was now
almost eleven. In one hour and a few minutes, it was
goodby to seventy-five thousand dollars for the purpose
of building and establishing a Y.M.C.A. for the black
youth of the city.</p>

<p>He heard Constance in the other room, breathing
heavily, and wondered whether she was sick. He watched
the clock now as a man who waits for the death knell.
Time seemed to go slowly, he thought. He would call
his sister when the clock reached a quarter of. Yes,
and together they would watch, watch, watch. He
dozed off to sleep. Suddenly he awoke with a start.
He had slept the old year out, was his first thought.
Then he looked at the clock. No, not quite. He rubbed
his eyes.</p>

<p>And then he listened. Had he heard someone, or
something? "Of course not," he muttered half aloud.
"This game is telling on me," and he raised his hand
and grasped his head. And still he felt something had
happened. He arose and walked back and forth across
the room, and then sat down again. As he did so, his
eyes saw the clock.</p>

<p>It was now eleven thirty-five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Into the Infinite Long Ago</i></p>


<p>"That is the Ponca, dear," said Sidney, taking her
hand, as they walked up the road.</p>

<p>"But you did not call it that in your story, Sidney,"
said Mildred, squeezing his hand fondly. "I have never
been on its banks. When are you going to take me
there?" she now said poutingly.</p>

<p>He placed his free hand under her chin, and dared her
to look into his face with such a frown. She failed, and
laughed instead.</p>

<p>"But I want to go," she cried, swinging the hand she
held back and forth. "Won't you take me soon&mdash;take
me today?" she begged.</p>

<p>He drew her to him, placed his arms about her, and
kissed her fondly.</p>

<p>A moment later they walked down the wide road.</p>

<p>"And this is the <i>Rosebud Country</i>," she said, allowing
her eyes to stretch over a land to which she saw no end.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is the <i>Rosebud Country</i>," he said contentedly.</p>

<p>She regarded him a moment closely, before she spoke.
In that look, she appeared to see him as she had never
seen him before. This man was her husband, and he
had spent the prime years of his life in this land to the
northwest. He loved it, and now she would love it,
because he did. In the years gone by he had hoped&mdash;he
had built his hopes here, and into that life had come
another. After that things had been different. Yes,
things had been different, and that was why she was
here. But she was happy. Yes, she was happy. He
was too, so that made her more happy.</p>

<p>"See those rocks on yonder hill?" she heard him say,
and she allowed her eyes to follow the direction of his
finger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and oh Sidney, I gaze each day at them, and
at the smaller one just this side of it. Tell me of them,
and of the little one, too."</p>

<p>And as they strolled together down this prairie road
to the valley of the Ponca, Sidney Wyeth, her husband,
told her the story of the two hills.</p>

<p>"Many, I know not how many years ago, yon hill
was the scene of many a crime, so the squaws told me."
And he sighed, as he seemed to look back over the time.
She placed her hand now in the curve of his arm and
held it closely. It seemed to satisfy him, and with a
glance at her, and a far away look in his eyes, he proceeded
to tell the legend of the hills.</p>

<p>"It was before the days of the mighty Sitting Bull,
and Red Cloud, too; before the days of the cowboy&mdash;and
even the squaw man. It was in the days of Chief Stinking
Eye, who was the bravest&mdash;so the Indians say&mdash;of all the
great Sioux warriors. Stinking Eye and Chief Bettleyon
loved one and the same maiden&mdash;the daughter of Chief
Go-Catch-The-Enemy.</p>

<p>"Go-Catch-The-Enemy was a great chief, and owned
all the land in what is called the Bull Creek district now,
while Bettleyon lived with the tribe of his father in a
part of this country far to the west, in that part which
is now called the Cottonwood Creek district.</p>

<p>"This vast tribe of red men lived by hunting principally;
but their women discovered that crops could be grown in
this soil, and, with rude plows and hoes, and whatever
they had, they dug little patches in the soil along the
creek, and in springtime, they planted these patches in
maize and beans; so, when the zero weather of winter
made the wigwams the most comfortable place, they
kept from starving by feeding thereon. Of course, that
was in the day when the buffalo was plentiful, and they
had meat; but with cornmeal this was made more
delicious. So, in this way, the Sioux Indians came
through many cold winters, and went to war again in
the early springtime; that is, the men did, while the
women repeated the task each year, of planting the patches
to Squaw corn or maize.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>"How they fought, and bled and died, is a matter not
trivial. About this time, there came a man. He rode a
pony, and he had on boots&mdash;not moccasins&mdash;and he
wore a hat on his head. He carried a rifle in his hand,
and that was the first time <i>these</i> red men had seen such
a weapon. Strange, as it was to them, he talked fluently
in their tongue, and withal his cleverness, he became a
favorite among the many. Before long he was, in reality,
chief over all. From the Niobrara across the Keya
Paha, including the Ponca, the Mastadon, on to the
Whetstone and Landing Creek and to the White River,
he ruled. They named him Rain-In-The-Face, and he
made them all believe that he was next to the great
white father.</p>

<p>"There came a day when he made love to Go-Catch-The-Enemy's
daughter, Winnetkha, which was her name,
and she was said to have been the most beautiful daughter
of the Sioux Indians the <i>Rosebud</i> had ever known.</p>

<p>"This, as you might expect, made enemies of Young
Chief Bettleyon and also Chief Stinking Eye. But the
white man was shrewd. He thought at night, when all
was quiet and the Indians slept. So the mornings were
used in carrying out the thoughts of the night before,
while the Indians had to think of war.</p>

<p>"So, before any knew, the white man had made
Winnetkha his own, and took her to live in a real house,
that he had made the Indians build for him, of straight
ash logs, with bark peeled off and hewn on the inside,
until the white wood glistened like silver.</p>

<p>"That was the beginning of the breeds, and after that,
many became crossed and have not stopped until recently;
but Bettleyon and Stinking Eye never got over it, and
when the pale face was spending his time herding the
cattle that were now replacing the buffalo, they intrigued
cruelly against him.</p>

<p>"Winnetkha overheard their plan, and informed him
when he came from the herd that night, and so he kept
watch. They came late, with a band of picked men and
loyal followers, and began at once to make war on the
big house. All night they fought, but the Indians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
shrewd this time, and fought from long range. They
shot at the house with arrows that were heated red hot
on the point, until at last they set it on fire. This, of
course, drove the white man and his squaw out. They
managed to escape and reached safety ere they were
discovered. But the white man was angry, and he
swore to have revenge, so, loading his rifle, he saddled
his horse and came down single-handed on the Indians
and killed many, and routed the rest.</p>

<p>"He was not bothered any more for years afterward,
but the Indian, you know, never forgets, so, one day,
when he was grazing his herds near the top of the hill,
he looked up to find himself almost hemmed in by the
skulking red devils. He rushed to safety behind the
rocks at the top, where you see them. Here he fought
until his ammunition was exhausted, and he was without
defense, with the Indians all about him.</p>

<p>"And it was then that he looked about for other
weapons of defense, and discovered a den of rattlers.
Then, one at a time, he allowed the Indians to approach
him, and as they did and went to look for him, they
were struck in the face by a rattler. More than twenty
were bitten, so 'tis said, and more than half died from
the effects. And then they killed him.</p>

<p>"Old Go-Catch-The-Enemy made war on them afterward
and a reign of outlawry began; but to the white
man, his son-in-law, he gave a great funeral, and did
not bury him on a tree top, where buzzards picked the
bones, as had been the custom; but the Indians preferred
such a burial rather than that a coyote should
dig them up from the earth. He was buried on the top
of the little hill to the side, as you see, with stones arranged
about him, and so deep in the earth, that the wolves
never bothered.</p>

<p>"So, that is the legend of those hills that you see,
and they are the land mark. Those who live here will
not soon forget it."</p>

<p>They stood on the banks of the Ponca now, and listened
to the happy birds that filled the air with music like
thousands of little bells. As they stood, arm in arm,
they appreciated all that life held in store for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly from the west came a great noise. "Hark!"
cried the husband. "A prairie fire? Of course not.
The settlers made that impossible long since." He
looked anxiously in the direction from whence came the
noise. The sun could not be seen, and everything at
once grew dark. "A tornado!" cried Sidney, and,
grabbing his wife, he started to fall to the ground, but
too late! A sudden wind seemed to pick him up, and a
moment later whirled him into the air, while Mildred
cried out in agonizing tones:</p>

<p>"Sidney, Sidney, come back, come back; don't leave
me!" But on he flew, with the wind raising him higher
and higher into the air, while she moaned until she felt
her heart would break. Everything was so dark about
her that she could not see, and then, suddenly it began
to clear. Darkness was not about her, for overhead
burned an electric light. She lay across a bed. She
stood up and looked about her.</p>

<p>Her brain throbbed terribly, while she tried to recall
where she was, and then slowly it all came back to her.
Miss Jones&mdash;the visit to the blind tiger&mdash;a bottle of
coca cola&mdash;"Oh, my God!" she cried in piteous tones.
"I'm lost! I'm lost! I'm lost!"</p>

<p>She rushed to the door. It was bolted. She paused a
moment as she stood by it. Where had <i>he</i> gone! She
had a watch on her wrist; she looked at it. She had
not been there long. She recalled looking at it just
before drinking the stuff in the glass. That was exactly
an hour before. It was fully a half hour later when she
had been brought to this place. But <i>where</i> was the man.</p>

<p>She looked across the room to a chair. Over the back
of it lay the overcoat he had worn. Then it became clear
to her. He had stepped out a moment to get something
perhaps. She walked to the door quickly and tried the
knob. It was locked and the key was gone. She became
frantic as she ran around the room. She tried the window
again. Useless. Besides, when she peeped under
the shade, it was too far to the ground. She stood
dumbly for a moment. Presently, mechanically, she
walked to a dresser that stood to one side, and peered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
in the glass at herself. She recoiled when she saw her
face. It was swollen, and her eyes looked strange. She
could not believe herself. She looked again. "Yes,"
she whispered, "this is <i>I</i>!" She looked away. The top
of the dresser was covered with a newspaper. Mechanically
she found herself looking over it. It was not a city
paper, she could see, so, somewhat curiously, she turned
it over and saw the front page. Her eyes chanced to
fall on an article two columns in width. She read a few
lines, and then, with a muffled cry, she staggered backward,
clutching the paper. She sought the chair or the
bed&mdash;anything, she was too weak to stand now. But,
ere she had reached either, she suddenly stood stiffly
erect, while the blood seemed to freeze in her veins.</p>

<p>A step sounded in the hallway, and a moment later,
a key rattled in the lock. The <i>man</i> was returning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am truly sorry to see the colored people of this
town fail in their effort to secure a Y.M.C.A. for their
youth," said the secretary of the white Y.M.C.A., as
he rested his elbows for a moment upon the cigar case.</p>

<p>"And they won't get it after all," said a young man
whose father had given five hundred dollars to the cause.
"They certainly need something of the kind. The crime
and condition of the colored people of the southern
states, give this section a bad name in the eyes of the
enlightened world," he commented, lighting a cigarette
and sprawling his legs in front of him, when he had taken
a seat.</p>

<p>"I regret it more because that fellow, Wilson Jacobs,
the secretary, has been a faithful worker, if there ever
was one," the secretary said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"How did they happen to fall down on it? I understand
that the white association has subscribed twenty-five
thousand dollars?" inquired another.</p>

<p>"So did a Chicago Jew, and likewise seventeen thousand
dollars were subscribed from the city and other places,
by the white people; but only ten thousand dollars could
be raised among the colored people&mdash;or rather, only
about five thousand. He secured about the same amount
from the white people here and in the north."</p>

<p>"I met that fellow down here one day, and say!"
exclaimed another, "he impressed me as much as any
person I ever met, I want to tell you!"</p>

<p>"How did they ever come out with the effort over at
Grantville?" inquired another.</p>

<p>"They failed," said the secretary, and then added:
"The gift from the Jew philanthropist has run for five
years, and expires tonight at twelve o'clock." So saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
all eyes sought the clock that hung on the wall above
them.</p>

<p>"They have only a few minutes left, according to that,"
smiled one.</p>

<p>"Say, wouldn't it be a sensation, if that fellow came
tearing in here at one minute to twelve," said one, and
laughed. The others joined in, but the secretary did
not share in the joke, notwithstanding that it was not
meant to be depreciating.</p>

<p>"If he should," said the secretary, walking from
behind the case, "I am authorized to acknowledge the
same, and the colored people would get their association.
But, of course, I do not anticipate such miracles tonight."</p>

<p>A moment later, they all filed to another part of the
building, where hundreds were gathered to watch the
old year out and the new in, and where music soon made
them forget the subject they had been discussing.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Twenty minutes of the year was left. In five minutes
Wilson Jacobs would call his sister, and together they
would watch. But the new year would bring no joy to
their hearts. It meant that a great struggle would end
in failure. He watched the clock by the minute. It was
now eleven forty-one. Nineteen minutes left.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a light footfall. He looked up and
saw his sister coming toward him. She looked tired and
worn; the strain she had been laboring under was plainly
evident in her face.</p>

<p>She came straight to him. What was it that made
her regard him as she did. Had she seen, in these last
minutes, how much it hurt him to have to pronounce his
great effort a failure. She advanced to where he sat,
and impulsively bent over and kissed him. As she
raised up, both pairs of eyes saw the clock, and both
pair of lips murmured:</p>

<p>"Eighteen minutes left." And then his lips said:</p>

<p>"Yes, sister, eighteen minutes left to raise twenty-five
thousand dollars for the Y.M.C.A. for our people."
He lowered his head, and sighed long and deeply. She
placed her hands about his forehead, and let them slip
back over his hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>"My poor brother, my poor brother!" And then, for
the first time she observed a package. With womanly
curiosity, she inquired:</p>

<p>"What is this, Wilson?" and pointed toward it. He
sat up quickly as though he had been asleep.</p>

<p>"That," he replied, blinking. "Why, I don't know.
I declare. I didn't know it was there." He was thoroughly
awake now, as well as curious.</p>

<p>"Wonder what it is," she said, curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he breathed, turning the package over.
"And you are sure you didn't put it there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, but I am curious to know what it contains,"
and she turned it over, while her face lit with a little
smile that was carefree. He saw it, and said:</p>

<p>"Why dear, if it will please you, open it as the last
thing in the old year."</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, that is so nice of you," and she took the
knife he handed her, opened it, and quickly cut the
strings. A package was enclosed, tied with paper. She
pursued the task of cutting strings, and then, as she
unwrapped the paper from about it she mused:</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder what it can be!" It was open now,
and two pairs of eyes opened their widest, while her
voice cried:</p>

<p>"Wilson, Wilson! My God! It's money! <i>It's money
to save the Y.M.C.A. for our people!</i>" Both now regarded
the clock. Fifteen minutes was left to reach the Y.M.C.A.
building thirteen blocks away! It was she who
spoke:</p>

<p>"Go brother! In God's name, go!"</p>

<p>Had it been any other night but the night of December
thirty-first, a man who tore wildly down the middle of
the street, bareheaded, and with a woman with hair
flowing loosely behind her, the officers on duty would
surely have made an arrest. But as it was, they only
smiled amusedly, as they remarked a new freak of meeting
the new year. How little did any feel or know that upon
that wild run, depended one hundred thousand dollars
for the salvation of thousands of black youth, until the
end of time....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>The papers carried the account in large headlines the
following morning.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"REVEREND WILSON JACOBS SPRINGS A COUP</p>

<p>"Energetic worker and secretary of the Y.M.C.A. for
the colored people raised twenty-five thousand dollars,
and completed the condition of the association at two
minutes of twelve o'clock last night. Two minutes
later, more than seventy-five thousand dollars would
have been unavailable for the purpose."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a column and a half, the people of the city and
elsewhere read the account of the wonderful victory that
meant so much for the colored people of the city, of
which the population was two-fifths. It was likewise a
victory for the white people, all of whom could appreciate
the fact. In securing the same, the city, with the unenviable
reputation of being one of the most criminal
cities in the world, now took first place in the line for
uplift among the colored people, as it would be the only
city in the south to have a Y.M.C.A. for its black
population.</p>

<p>The fact made thousands of black people buy the
blind tigers and drugstores out of whiskey on New
Years day. <i>It was their greatest day since freedom!</i></p>

<p>In Grantville, everybody wondered how they had done
it, and in Effingham and Attalia; and then the people
of the fortunate city wondered too, after their excitement
had cooled and they could think. Wilson Jacobs wondered
likewise, and so did Constance. Everybody
wondered.</p>

<p>But they never knew.</p>

<p>"Do you read d' papers?"</p>

<p>"A' co'se I does. Wha' kind-a 'sinuations y're tryin'
t' pass on me, nigga?" said one, whose feelings were, at
that moment, very much injured.</p>

<p>The heavy train pulled cumbersomely to the summit,
and stopped a moment, while the switch engine attached
to the rear, was uncoupled. A moment later, it continued
on its way.</p>

<p>Miles to the rear and below Effingham it struggled for
one brief moment, and then, as a curve in the mountain
was being made, it finally disappeared from view.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth settled back in his seat in the front end
of the Jim Crow car, and, with his feet spread over the
seat ahead, prepared himself languidly to enjoy the
four hundred odd miles that were before him.</p>

<p>Only half a car, possibly not that much, was given
over to the use of the colored passengers. It was as
comfortable as the other part of the train, however, so
no discrimination was evident. The portion given to
them was, of course, next to the baggage car; while far
to the rear, as he observed when the train rounded a curve,
fully eight or ten cars were more or less filled with white
passengers. About half the number were Pullmans.</p>

<p>"Den 'f y' read d' papers, yu autta know 'bout dis
'scrimination dat is a-goin' on up dere in Washington,"
he overheard between three or four Negroes a few seats
to the rear.</p>

<p>"Ah reads th' papers eve' day; but I 'on know wha'
you's a-drivin' at," contended another.</p>

<p>"Den you do'n read d' papers den, case all dis accurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
up dere las' fall, 'n' dere was a big awgument 'bout it,
'n' all de no'then papers done took sides agi'nst d' president."</p>

<p>"Aw, sho!" cried the second speaker now quickly.
"Ah knows what youah talkin' 'bout now, sho thing!"
And he nodded his head understandingly. The other
observed him nevertheless, dubiously, but was patient
while the other enlightened him.</p>

<p>"Yeh; you 'ferrin' t' dat bill dey had up dare about
'scriminatin' ag'inst nigga's. M-m. Yeh. Des 'ere bill
was a pretest from&mdash;well, somebody up no'th, a'-cose;
but it's to make dem stop havin' nigga's eatin' in d'
kitchen, dat us it, sho," and he looked about him into
the faces of the listeners.</p>

<p>The first speaker, confident at first that he was going
to show the other up as not knowing as much as he,
looked a trifle disappointed; but he didn't grant the
other the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>The second speaker went on:</p>

<p>"Yeh, I don read all 'bout dat. Yu see," he explained
very ostentatiously, "dare was 'n' editor, a sma't nigga
frum Boston who had done <i>been t' school 'n' graduated
frum college, and knowed ebreting</i>, 'n' 'e 'as a bill down

So dis nigga 'e finally git mad 'n' takes it 'roun' to de

Well, du' president 'e is so mad dat he sto'm, 'n' finally
says: 'I won' sign dat bill, I won' sign hit! Befo' I'll
sign that bill&mdash;'n' 'e strikes 'is desk wi' 'is fist&mdash;'I'll qui'

<p>"But," said another, who, up to this time, had taken
no part in the harrangue, "the president, ah taut, ain'
axed t' sign a bill ontell it had been acted on by congress."</p>

<p>The others looked at each other now, in some surprise.
Then they observed the speaker, in a manner that was
serene with contempt, for his apparent ignorance. (?)
Then the second speaker said:</p>

<p>"Aw, dis bill, y' see, 'us a secret. Dey wa'nt but
three people knowed 'bout it. 'N' dey was du editor
and du president&mdash;'n'&mdash;," he was thoughtful now, as he
meditated for a moment, and then said, "<i>Roosevelt!</i>"</p>

<p>By this time the train had gotten under way, and it
thundered on its way southward, down among the scrub
pines that stood back from the single track. Croppings
of iron, Wyeth observed, reached far to the south of
Effingham, while the country, as far as soil was concerned,
was a desolate lot of red clay and rock. The train tore
through numerous little towns, consisting of a number of
shacks, built mostly of plain boards, standing straight
up and down, with smaller boards nailed on the cracks.
Before some of these shanties played white children,
whose appearance showed the life they lived, which was
apparently that of poverty; while at some distance, he also
observed were other houses, not as respectable as those
behind which white children played, and occupied by
Negroes. Little patches of cleared land that was scratched
over, denoted that agriculture was attempted in even
this poor soil. By the slenderness of the dead stalks, he
could see that it would take many acres to produce a
bale of cotton.</p>

<p>On to the south the train hurried, and as they neared
the capital of the state, he observed, with some encouragement,
that the soil grew a little deeper; but, at the best,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
would have been laughed at back in the <i>Rosebud Country</i>.
And the same sight met his gaze all along. This had
once been a proud, aristocratic state; but, he wondered
if it became so by the returns of crops from such poor
land. Yet he was seeing only a small part of it from
the car window.</p>

<p>A cotton gin greeted the traveler at almost every
station; while everywhere the scrub pines and rocks
were largely in evidence. If all the state was like what
he saw from the car window, with the exception of that
which lay about the capital for a distance of fifteen or
twenty miles, he scarcely wondered that so many Negroes
preferred the city, where wages were sufficient to give
them something in life.</p>

<p>It was a cold, disagreeable day in the beginning;
but, as afternoon wore on, he was cheered to see the
elements clear, and the air become warmer.</p>

<p>The highlands were behind them now, and had given
place to great trees, while back from the track log houses
interspersed the forest here and there. The further
south the train pulled, the deeper became the swamp,
while the trees towered to heights that could not be
fully estimated from the car window. The atmosphere,
which had before been dry, was now charged with a
peculiar dampness, that seemed to rise from the earth,
which melted away from the tracks.</p>

<p>After many miles, in which the afternoon sun barely
penetrated the deep forest, the train passed through
another pine district. The trees were slender and scattered,
while thousands of stumps stood lowly and darkly
about. As he looked closer, he saw that among the
standing timber, at the base, were little buckets. He
made inquiries and was told that this was where turpentine
came from. He laughed then at his ignorance.
He had forgotten entirely that it was the south which
produced the greatest amount of this article.</p>

<p>"And when they have tapped the tree for such a
purpose, I suppose it is of no further good but to be
cut down?"</p>

<p>"They cut them down at once, and make most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
them into cord wood," replied the person of whom he
asked.</p>

<p>"Now these people," said Wyeth, pointing to the
black people, "they attend to the most of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the women to the turpentine, and the men to
the timber."</p>

<p>The train had now come into a land of swamp. As
far as eyes could see, there was a profusion of vines and
palm leaves. He wondered if that was where the palm
leaf fans came from. If so, the harvest was abundant.
For miles and miles the swamp was thick with them, and
they appeared to be all of fan size. Water stood a foot
deep, while the track rose, perhaps, upwards of four or
five feet above it all. The trees were a strange variety
to him, while nowhere for miles did it appear possible
for anyone to live. The mosquitoes, he judged, must
surely find this place a haven when the days were warm;
while fever could fairly thrive.</p>

<p>Now the train had left the deeper forests, and was
rolling across numerous trestles that stood high above
the water. Great lagoons were crossed, where large
birds, sea gulls and others not so large, flew about undisturbed.
Miles away at last, rose church spires and
ship hoists, and he then knew they were approaching a
city that was a great seaport.</p>

<p>A half hour later, they stood in the station. He found
his way out over the tracks and into the station, where
he entered the colored waiting room and lunch counter.
They were supposed to stop twenty minutes there; but,
before the lunch he had ordered was served, he observed
the train pulling out. He tore out and was about to
pass through a gate that was open, but was halted by a
young white man, who informed him that it was the
gate white people passed through.</p>

<p>"But I'm traveling on that train, and it is pulling
out," he cried frantically.</p>

<p>"Don't make any difference," said the other coldly.
"Enter through the niggers' gate," and pointed to the
rear. Wyeth tore down there, but it was closed and
locked. He gave up. Aboard the train was his luggage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
while he must stand and see it go on without him, simply
for the sake of a rule, that Negroes and whites cannot
walk through the same gate. He was disgusted over
such an occurrence, and stood watching his train disappear.
It had gone well toward the end of the yards,
when it came to a stop, while the locomotive attached
thereto, whistled two or three times. Another man
came to the gate, and Wyeth said to him:</p>

<p>"I'm traveling on that train. Can I not pass through
this gate and catch it?"</p>

<p>He was permitted to, and breathed a deep drawn sigh.
As he passed the fop who kept him back, he gave him
a look, and wished they were both in the <i>Rosebud Country</i>
at that moment....</p>

<p>A waiter, who had seen him go into the station, had
the vestibule of the diner open, and it was through this
he entered, as he caught the moving train.</p>

<p>"I knew you would get balled up!" he exclaimed.
"I saw your controversy at the gate.... And wasn't
surprised, for you see, this is a <i>white man's country</i>."
Thereupon he smiled a hard, dry smile. Wyeth passed
forward to the Jim Crow car, and forgot the incident,
for it was best so.</p>

<p>They had now come into the greater city, and he
got off.</p>

<p>"Where can good accommodations be had here?" he
inquired of the porter.</p>

<p>"Want a place to stop?" His face lightened perceptibly.
"If you will wait until I get through&mdash;say ten or
fifteen minutes&mdash;I'll carry you to a good place," he said,
and Sidney waited.</p>

<p>He sat in the waiting room listening to the noise without.
About the four sides of the wall, sat many little
girls&mdash;that is, girls. They smiled upon him, and made
immodest advances. He wondered at it, but then he
recalled that this was supposed to be the most profligate
town in our states. He paid little attention to them.
Others entered, and they smiled upon them also.</p>

<p>Presently the porter appeared, clothing changed, and
dressed neatly. Several of the girls gathered about him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
and said many foolish things. He smiled upon some of
them, while he told others to go to the devil; and still
others he told to go to&mdash;&mdash;but we will stop here.
And then they told him he could go there, too. They
left then, and Wyeth and he walked up a street that
was the widest, he felt certain, that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" inquired the porter.</p>

<p>Wyeth told him; whereupon the other whistled.</p>

<p>"That's a long way from here. How do you like these
parts?"</p>

<p>Wyeth didn't answer the last; but to the first he said:
"Yes, a long way," and fell silent.</p>

<p>"Ever been here before?" said the porter.</p>

<p>"Twelve years and more ago."</p>

<p>"See quite a difference now, eh?"</p>

<p>"I was not here long enough to see what there was in
the beginning."</p>

<p>They walked up a street that was intersected at
various and irregular intervals, by numerous other streets,
that were as narrow, if not more so, than the one they
were following was wide. In the center of the wide
street were four car lines. This part of the street was
raised above the other, and was protected by a curbing, that
prevented anything with wheels from crossing, only at
the intersections. Wyeth remembered this. It was
something he had never seen elsewhere, and he wondered
who could have conceived the idea of making one street
so wide, and then crossing it with others that were so
narrow that only one single street car track was possible,
and, when passing down it, the wagons on either side
had to hug the curbing closely, or be collided with.</p>

<p>"A beautiful place," he commented, pointing to the
maze of electric lights that lined the narrow cross streets,
and made their way as bright as day&mdash;brighter, he came
afterwards to see, when it rained.</p>

<p>"This town was settled by French and Spaniards
many years ago, and they were very artistic in planning
for the future of the city," said the other.</p>

<p>"It is apparent on all sides; I can see that," Wyeth
agreed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are some of the most beautiful colored people
here you ever saw," said the other.</p>

<p>"There is one now," said Wyeth, as a woman, different
from the kind he had been accustomed to, passed by.</p>

<p>"Creole," advised the other.</p>

<p>"And this is their native soil, so I understand," said
Wyeth, turning his head to take another look at the
woman with the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"There are some," said the porter, "who cannot speak
English at all."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Wyeth.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the other. "Plenty cannot speak a
word of English, and they may be found in what is
called the French district. It is there you find them
with the most beautiful skin, and the finest and heaviest
hair you ever saw."</p>

<p>"I hear they have frightful tempers," said Wyeth.
"Is it true?"</p>

<p>"I would advise you to avoid any conflict with them,
lest you find out," said the other, smiling amusedly.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said Wyeth, pointing to a bar before
which stood many men drinking.</p>

<p>"Why, what?" said the other, then replied: "A
saloon."</p>

<p>"And they are open on Sunday?" Yet he was not
surprised when he had thought, for he had seen the
same elsewhere. But the other replied:</p>

<p>"The saloons never close here."</p>

<p>"Never close! What do you mean?" said Wyeth.</p>

<p>"What I say," from the other.</p>

<p>"And still I do not understand you," said Wyeth.
And then added: "What time do they open in the
morning?"</p>

<p>"They do not close at night; therefore, they do not
have to go to the trouble of opening in the morning."</p>

<p>"Uh huh!"</p>

<p>"There are saloons here that boast of having not
closed since before the Revolutionary War."</p>

<p>"Good night!" Wyeth laughed. "Something historical
down here!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll learn more when you have been here a while.
This is the city of history&mdash;American history. We turn
here."</p>

<p>And Wyeth came to see for himself. They were
crossing the wide street now, and went up another that
was as wide, but no cars ran up that way.</p>

<p>"This is Basin court," said the other, as they paused
outside of a two-story structure, that opened its doors
upon the street.</p>

<p>A big, fat, brown-skinned man appeared presently,
and bade them enter.</p>

<p>When they were inside they met another&mdash;a woman,
and she was fatter still. It was the man's wife, and she
appeared to be in charge, from her statements regarding
the rental. They were from Alabama, and one glance
was sufficient to show they were not creole.</p>

<p>Wyeth bought some beer, and the fat man went for it
with a pitcher. He returned with as much for a dime, as
would have cost twenty-five cents in Effingham. He
said so to the other, and then the others laughed and
said:</p>

<p>"This is the city where they drink it. They drink
more here than anywhere else in the world." Wyeth
recalled a year before&mdash;but then these people had seen
only a small part of the world, as their conversation
later revealed, and, of course&mdash;but it didn't matter.</p>

<p>"You genemens goin' to the dance?" said the woman.</p>

<p>"To the dance?" Wyeth repeated. "This is Sunday!"</p>

<p>They smiled at him now&mdash;all of them&mdash;and then said:</p>

<p>"Sunday is the day of sport in this town. More
dances occur on Sunday than any other day."</p>

<p>Wyeth whistled.</p>

<p>"This is the creole city," and they smiled again.</p>

<p>"This gentleman is from a more pious territory," said
the porter, appreciatively. He seemed to be very intelligent.</p>

<p>"What kind of work do the genemen follow?" asked
the hostess.</p>

<p>"Books," Wyeth replied.</p>

<p>"They don't read much down here," she said, dubiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some do everywhere&mdash;more or less!"</p>

<p>"They are strongly engaged in the art of having a
good time here," remarked the porter, and laughed.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Wyeth. "And, since practically
half of the colored people of the state are illiterate, I am,
of course, compelled to agree with you."</p>

<p>They talked on other topics now, and Wyeth, not
feeling sleepy, suggested venturing out sight seeing.
He went alone, and what he saw, he did not soon forget.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind him, and his steps
died away in the distance, the fat man winked and the
woman smiled; then the pair spoke, in the same breath:</p>

<p>"Books&mdash;huh! He he! Books&mdash;huh! He he!" They
regarded the porter with a smile; but he did not, strange
to say, share their point of view. But they had their
say, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Books&mdash;huh!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>At Last She Didn't Care</i></p>


<p>Mildred stood in the middle of the room, directly under
the electric light that filled the room with its bright
rays. She could see the end of the key, as it turned in
the lock, and, in that moment, a scheme entered her
head, like a flash. Locating the direction of the door,
and facing toward it, she reached up suddenly and
switched off the light. Instantly the room was ingulfed
in darkness. She hurried to the door, and stood just to
one side. Presently the knob turned and the man
entered. He stood on the threshold a moment, and she
heard him say:</p>

<p>"Ah, the little girl is sleeping peacefully," and laughed.
"That was a devil of a dose a-whiskey that girl gave
her, though! Knocked her stiff! Darned if I don't
believe she was handing the straight dope after all."
He advanced now toward the middle of the room. Quick
as a flash she stepped out, and, seeing he had left the
key in the lock, she jerked the door closed, and, turning
the key, which she allowed to remain, rushed to the end
of the steps, and hurried down as fast as she could safely
venture.</p>

<p>It was dark outside, and no one stood about the
entrance. She struck the pavement, looked up and down
a brief moment, and then hurried in a direction that led
to whither she knew not, but to escape was her only
thought. She hurried along for fully three blocks, and
then turned in another direction, and then one block in
another, and paused&mdash;feeling safe at last.</p>

<p>Up to this time, she was not conscious that her head
was aching to a point that was almost splitting. She
placed her hand upon her forehead, and only then was
she aware that she had the paper she had picked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
the dresser, closely clutched in her hand. The words
she had seen there, made her at once forget her headache
and all else.</p>

<p>She thought of something then. She looked at the
watch on her wrist. "Yes, thank God, there is yet
time." An hour later she came back to the place where
she had stood, and continued in the direction she had
been going, looking from right to left for a lodging house.</p>

<p>She stopped at several places where a sign over the
front advertised rooms, but, at each one they wanted
men only. She had no thought of going back to where
she had been stopping the last week; and, besides, she
knew not where she was, nor did she know the street or
number where she had been stopping, therefore was
confident she could not have found it, had she wished
to return.</p>

<p>Upon the street, she encountered many people celebrating
the event of the coming year, and then she tried a
small house that set back in a yard, and which appeared
very neat from where she viewed it. She secured a
room, and retired at once. Setting the oil lamp on a
chair next to the bed, she unfolded the paper and read
the article on the front page carefully, over and over
again. It was an Effingham paper, and a date of some
time before. When she had read it, until she was convinced
that she was not dreaming, she sighed restfully
as she murmured:</p>

<p>"At last, oh Lord, at last!"</p>

<p>It was the Effingham <i>Age-Herald</i>, and the issue contained
the article by Sidney Wyeth, in which he severely
arraigned the leading people of his race in that city for
their disregard of the general welfare of their people.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad, so glad," she whispered softly. "And
to think that it came to my attention in such an extraordinary
manner!" She felt her forehead, and winced
when the heat and throb came into contact with the
touch. She made a wry face, as she recalled the taste
of stale whiskey. Only then did she become aware, that
when she had turned at the sound of the piano, someone
had filled her glass with liquor. And she had drunk it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
before she realized that it had been doped. She thought
of the incident; from the time she had met Miss Jones
at the corner, and had been informed of the part of the
town she was in. She shuddered and drew the coverlets
closely about her, as her mind went over it again. She
then tried to recall how she had followed Miss Jones to
the place where she had met the men. And there she
had drunk for the first time in her life, whiskey, although
she was not at the moment aware of it. She rose out of
the bed, as the dream came back to her; how the tornado
had taken Sidney into the air, and then the story of the
hills and the Indians. She pondered for a time, and
wondered if such a thing had been the history of the
<i>Rosebud Country</i>. And Sidney Wyeth had not been
caught in a tornado, but had swept a multitude of people
with his pen, in a burning article. She read over a part
of it again. The very evils he had berated the most
fiercely, were the things she had heard Wilson Jacobs
deplore, and speak of more than once. Yes, Sidney Wyeth
had written the truth. And from the way it was pictured,
she reckoned that it must have created a bit of excitement.
And that was the kind of man Sidney Wyeth was.
She smiled as she thought of it.</p>

<p>"And I love him. Was it because of these principles,
that I strangely felt were inherent in him, that he has
been my dream, which has grown larger in my estimation,
in the months I have had no word of him?" she asked
herself. "I am going to him&mdash;I am, tomorrow. Of
course," she replied to herself in the next sentence, "I am
not going directly to him.... He wouldn't quite appreciate
that&mdash;oh, he wouldn't appreciate me at all;
but I love him, and am going where he is, and after
that&mdash;&mdash;" she had no other words, nor thoughts. To
be where he was, maybe to see him, became the uppermost
desire in her mind.</p>

<p>She did not, strangely enough, think any more about
the Y.M.C.A. She thought of her lover as, with a
peaceful smile, she fell asleep. She did not dream that
night, but lay as she had fallen asleep, and it was six
o'clock the following morning, the first of January, when
she awakened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>She lay a half hour without any thoughts in her mind,
and then, observing a window next to the bed, she
raised it slightly, and peeped out. It was not yet so
very light. It was, apparently, a quiet street, occupied
by working people who were now in many numbers on
the way to their work. A boy with a bunch of papers
under his arm was passing in their midst, and then suddenly
she wrapped on the window pane. He looked up,
being accustomed to doing so, and, catching sight of her
hand, entered the gate and stood under the window with
an upraised paper, while she fished out a nickel and
dropped it into his hand.</p>

<p>She smiled with an expression of satisfaction, as she
read the article relating to the Y.M.C.A. for colored
youth of the city, and was glad to note that Wilson
Jacobs came in for a great deal of praise. She laid it
aside for a time, and was thoughtful again.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered to herself, "I will leave the city
at once. The one thing I so much desired, and which
has kept me here through these weary months, has been
obtained." She closed her lips and planned further.</p>

<p>She decided to go to Effingham. She would send an
expressman for her things at Mother Jane's that morning.
She would then purchase a ticket and go by the first
train. She turned to the editorial column of the paper,
and was made happy by a lengthy editorial, relating the
effort for the Y.M.C.A., and praising Wilson Jacobs
further.</p>

<p>She did not know, however, that the editor of the
paper that she was reading, and who was one of the most
ardent supporters in the Christian forward movement in
the south, had been at the Y.M.C.A. the evening
before. He had come with the others, out of curiosity,
when Wilson Jacobs had torn into the building, bareheaded
and looking like an insane man. And he had
written the article the first thing in the new year.</p>

<p>She arose and dressed herself at seven o'clock, and
slipped out of the house without awakening anyone.
It was getting light now, and she went some blocks
before she encountered an expressman that satisfied her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
She gave him the instructions, and walked about, impatiently,
while she waited for him to return. As she
was waiting, she became possessed with a desire to see
the little house occupied by the Jacobs, and where she
had spent so many happy, hopeful months.</p>

<p>She had no trouble finding it, since light had given
her an acquaintance with her surroundings. She found
that she was not far from it, and then recognized with a
start, that the same drayman she had sent for the goods,
was the one who had taken the same from the Jacobs' a
few months before. He had not recognized her, and she
now gave him no further chance to do so.</p>

<p>She walked until the house was in sight, and then,
going around a block, she found herself within a half
block of it. Smoke was coming from the kitchen chimney,
and she knew they were astir.</p>

<p>"Bless them!" she murmured, as she realized how
happy must be their hearts that morning. "And that
is why they are astir so soon. They do not usually arise
until nearly eight o'clock."</p>

<p>As she stood gazing longingly at the house, she saw
Constance emerge from the rear, and scatter wheat to a
few chickens they had taken a delight in raising the past
summer. "If I could only go to her in this minute, and
feel her caress for just a moment, I would leave the city
the happiest woman in the world." She stopped when
she had said this. To realize that she was slipping out of
the city like a criminal, without greeting the friends she
had there, made her feel peculiarly guilty. She had no
enmity in her heart toward anyone&mdash;not even the man
who haunted her into the position she now assumed, and
whose sole purpose had been to satisfy an animal
desire. She knew she could not go to Constance, nor to
Mother Jane's&mdash;nor to anyone. She would leave the city
without saying goodbye to a soul. She turned her face
away, as she recalled that she had left Cincinnati the
same way. She had no friends there, and had avoided
making acquaintances. She almost choked with guilty
anguish as she asked herself:</p>

<p>"Is it always to be this way? Am I forever to go from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
place to place under cover like a criminal? Am I always
to be without friends?" She couldn't make answer.
She could have a certain kind of friends; but she shuddered
when she realized what kind they would be. She
had never told anyone the secret.</p>

<p>She had no desire, strangely, to do so. Only one
person among those she loved knew it, she now conjectured.
And she would leave to be near him soon.
He knew&mdash;a part of it ... and he had turned away and
had passed out of her life, when he learned it. He would
never come back; he would never forget it&mdash;and even if,
through any possible chance, she proved to him that it
was all a very different problem, could he ever forgive
her? Perhaps that was what made it harder to bear.
She almost believed he would not. In reading his book,
she had marked a cold, decided stand, and she felt that,
if he had made up his mind against her, which he had
apparently done, he was not likely to change.... It
depended upon the strength of his resolutions. She could
never get beyond a certain point in her dreams. But in
spite of that fact, something within her longed to be near
him; to see him; not to ask forgiveness&mdash;not to do
anything; but just to be near him, that was all.</p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs stood on the porch at the front of the
house now, smoking a cigar in a way, she could at this
distance see, he enjoyed. Yesterday morning he could
not have smoked in so much peace; but today, the
future was brighter than it had ever been for him; she
felt this, and it was true. As he stood looking about
him, Wilson Jacobs was happy. He was not happy over
his own success&mdash;for Wilson Jacobs did not feel that he
had made the success&mdash;but he was happy from the fact
that the young Negro men of that wicked, criminally
torn city, would soon be the recipients of a movement
that would insure a brighter future, less tinged with
degradation and vice.</p>

<p>Presently he turned, as though responding to a call,
and entered the house. Mildred surmised that he had
been called to breakfast. She turned on her heel, and
went back to the expressman's place, and met him
returning with the things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>They were all packed. The trunk only required a rope
around it, and it was ready for the station. She instructed
the expressman to this end, and met him at the
depot, where she purchased a ticket for Effingham.</p>

<p>She strolled outside and to a nearby restaurant, where
she partook of a hearty breakfast, for she was hungry.
She returned to the station, and waited patiently for the
arrival of the train from the north, that would take her
away from the city where she had been for many months.
If it had not fallen to her lot to encounter the man who
had known her back in Cincinnati, she could have left
the city with friends at the depot, and much more ceremoniously;
but she was glad that she was leaving it as
it was. When she had awakened the evening before, she
had, for a moment, felt that she could not leave it without
a terrible pang of conscience.</p>

<p>The train had arrived, and the people were hurrying
in that direction. She joined them, and, as she was
passing through the gate, she turned for a moment, and
looked into the face of the man who had sent her away
like this. She regarded him without a tremor of fright.
At last she didn't care. A moment later she entered
the car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>They Knew He Had Written the Truth</i>"</p>


<p>"Yes," said the man, "I knew Sidney Wyeth well.
He was, in fact, a personal friend of mine; and, let me
tell you, Madam, there never was a fellow more interested
in the welfare of his people, from a general point of view,
than the one you inquire about."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she echoed, with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam, I speak the truth. My name is Jones,"
he said. "I am the editor of the <i>Reporter</i>, and Mr. Wyeth
used to drop into the office here quite often, and talk
with me about the condition of our people in the south.
He was a conscientious fellow, void of pretense, and with
a regard for anyone's point of view. Yes, Wyeth was
a fellow who insisted upon calling a spade a spade, not a
hoe; but there is an element of people here&mdash;or was,
rather&mdash;before the appearance of an arraignment by
Wyeth, who had only contempt for anyone's opinion
other than their own. Oh, I'll tell you, Miss, you cannot
imagine how this has been worrying me for years. I
have been conducting this paper for some time, and have
struggled to make it a good sheet; but, of course, we
cannot collect from advertising and make our paper pay,
as we would like to see it." He paused a moment, and
then, making himself more comfortable, he fell into a
long conversation, in which, with much fervor, he told
Mildred Latham, whom he had observed was a careful
and appreciative listener, of the conditions Sidney Wyeth
had seen and had written about.</p>

<p>"The papers told about the success of Wilson Jacobs
in securing a Y.M.C.A. for the town northwest of here,
and God knows how glad I am to see that our people in
the south are coming to appreciate a Christian forward
movement. We have been, in a way, steering in a direc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>tion
that got us nowhere, and that was the way Wyeth
used to discuss it. We have here, and in the town just
mentioned, the worst Negroes under the sun, and yet
counted as civilized people. And it seems to have been
forgotten or overlooked, that our salvation, in a moral
sense, as well as in a practical and progressive, depends
first upon our own initiative. I cannot account for the
selfishness that has so pervaded the lives of our professional
people. Last summer, in a lengthy article, a
Mr. B.J. Dickson, editor of the <i>Attalia Independent</i>,
scored the physicians of that city for a little incident,
that in itself showed a mark of narrowness that few
would or could be brought to believe."</p>

<p>He then related the article in brief, stating that the
color line had been drawn among the colored people
themselves, and became very much worked up over the
fact that most of the people who had been invited, did
not, as a rule, employ Negro doctors for professional
purposes.</p>

<p>"I have hinted at the things Mr. Wyeth attacked in
his article, and I have, more than once, pointed to the
evils in our own society; but no one paid any attention.
No, they were too self-opinionated. They could not see
their faults in a Negro paper; but, when it was brought
to their attention on the front page of one of the most
conservative papers conducted by whites in the south,
well, then, it appeared altogether different.</p>

<p>"They stewed and deplored, became indignant, and all
that; but the truth cannot be played with. With all
the noise that followed the publication of the article,
conscience became a burden. They knew to the last
one, that Sidney Wyeth had written the truth, and
nothing but the truth. And, thanks to God, there were
enough good people to say, when the demagogues were
decrying it, that it was the truth. So now, in this city,
where times are hard, and many people are out of work;
but with plenty of time to think it over, there is in evidence
a decided change, and it is my opinion, that next
summer will see this new idea put into effect&mdash;at least
started."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>"So, Mr. Wyeth has located permanently here?" she
inquired, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied quickly. "I had become so
stirred, when I recalled how much life and appreciation
that article of his had inspired in the order of existence
about here, that I forgot to say that Mr. Wyeth has
left the city. In fact, he left the city immediately after
the appearance of the article."</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and swallowed with surprise
and disappointment. He had left the city. Where had
he gone to? She was afraid to inquire. But Jones was
speaking again, and saved her the embarrassment of
inquiring.</p>

<p>"Yes, he left a day or so afterward. He is not likely
to locate in the south. And, moreover, his mission in
these parts is not, I am sure, one of locating or hunting a
location. He appears to be one seeking the truth about
our people." He told her of Wyeth's departure to the
creole city, and then, obviously anxious to unload his
burden of opinions, to which she listened with patient
interest, he continued:</p>

<p>"I am of the opinion that he will write a book on
these conditions in the near future. And, if it compares
with his article and carries a romance interwoven, it will
meet with public appreciation. He always spoke of his
home out west with much longing, and I suppose that
the atmosphere out there must be of the progressive
spirit, which makes a difference when one is forced to
tolerate the conditions of sluggishness down here."</p>

<p>"How are the people here on Christian forward work?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"They had never thought of such a thing until Wyeth
wrote the article, and it was the same in regard to a
library and a park. You see, Madam, it has been like
this," he explained: "Our people have been in the habit
of accepting everything (when it came to uplift) from
the white people as a matter of course, never letting it
worry them, as far as their own efforts were concerned.
Then, again, what few books have been written, with
some exceptions (novels especially, and of which our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
race has produced but few) have dealt with the Negro as
a poor, persecuted character, deserving everybody's sympathy.
In some manner, the authors have been either
careful to avoid his more inherent traits, or they were so
fired with their subject matter, that they forgot it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Wyeth brought in a couple of books he had sent
for, and which were written by the most successful fiction
writer our race has known. He read them, and pointed
out that only a slight mention was made therein, that
the Negro would lie&mdash;'excuse the expression'&mdash;and steal,
get drunk, and fight, and kill and gamble to such an
extent, that he would lose his last dollar, and lie out of
paying an honest debt.</p>

<p>"Anyone who conscientiously knows the Negro, must
certainly be aware of these traits. Why then, should a
writer build a work of the imagination, in which he
seeks to reveal to the reader the white man's hatred for
his black brother, without including in the same statement,
that the Negro has inherent traits, which are some
of the worst evils good society is called upon to endure?
Wyeth judged this was the reason why these books did
not sell and the authors ceased to write, since they could
not work without a living profit.</p>

<p>"Of course, when we allow ourselves, our thoughts,
rather, to dwell upon the white man's prejudice, we will
surely become pessimists. Who is not aware of it? But
it is the purpose of the practical Negro to forget that
condition as much as possible. To allow our minds to
dwell upon it, and predict what is likely to happen, is
only to prepare ourselves for eternal misery. So far as
I believe, it is my opinion that the white man will always
hate the Negro. It may be argued that it is un-Christianlike,
which is true; but the fact to be reckoned with,
and which remains, is that the white man dislikes Negroes.
But, when we have our own welfare to consider first and
last, it is logical that we turn our energies to a more
momentary purpose.</p>

<p>"I read Derwins' first book, a work of sociology, and
which met a great sale, and thereby brought him into
public notice. Then I read his late one, a novel, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
which he portrayed the evil of prejudice. Like the
other author I refer to, he built his plot entirely upon
that, leaving the fact that the Negro possesses the
many vices I have mentioned to be understood. Of all
races, the Negro is the most original and humorous.
Those who know him, even the least, look for some
humor. Fancy, then, how people must be disappointed,
when they purchase and read a volume concerning
that race, and find it void of humor! The work of both
these men, like works other than fiction, by Negroes,
is couched in the most select words; but the people look
for what they know to be current. And when they do
not find it, they are likely to lay the book aside, and pick
up something that is more to their taste.</p>

<p>"And, with all due regard for the writings of these men,
if you read their works carefully, you will discover their
own lack of confidence in the race whose cause they
champion. I will relate a little incident to show this:</p>

<p>"Follow the romance, and you will find it invariably
centered about a white couple. Why have they done
this? The answer will be, a moral; but, in my opinion,
they could not imagine a Negro character strong enough
to weave into the plot, and, therefore, substituted white
lovers, because, in their imagination, it was more fitting.</p>

<p>"These men have quit writing, from the fact, that it
did not pay; for, it takes a world of thought, concentrated
upon a certain purpose, to write a novel. Any
man with the ability to put a great thought into words,
and to employ words that are select, in the manner
these men did in their books, could, at least should be,
practical enough to do so in such a manner as to win
an audience that would pay sufficiently for their work to
maintain them. Instead of that, they have both quit
writing. They were sincere, but did the worst possible
thing by quitting. For the quitter never gains anything;
and, when it comes to championing the cause of a people,
the persons who have attempted the same, should certainly
adhere to the task." He paused now, as someone
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," he called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman, neatly dressed and attractive in appearance,
and apparently intelligent, entered.</p>

<p>"How do, Mr. Jones," she cried, stretching forth her
hand. Mildred rose to go, but Jones waved her back.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Langdon," he said kindly, "I am glad to see
you. Be seated." She took a seat. She turned to
Mildred, who looked as though she felt she was intruding,
and said:</p>

<p>"It is nothing private!"</p>

<p>She drew from her bag a few sheets of paper, and,
smoothing them out, she handed them to the editor with:
"Here is a little article I have written, in honor of the
young lady who is soon to make her appearance here in
recital, as you know, and which has been well advertised.
I wish to have you publish it in your paper," and then
she smiled sweetly and affected much modesty, as she
added: "It will not be necessary that you mention the
same is written by me."</p>

<p>"But I wish you to have all that is your due, Mrs.
Langdon," he protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then," she said, and rising, with a
few more words, she took her leave.</p>

<p>Jones glanced over the page, and then started. "Excuse
me just a moment, Miss," he begged, and read the pages
which were neatly written and punctuated. When he
had finished, he smiled and said, under his breath:
"That is certainly nerve."</p>

<p>Mildred regarded him curiously. He looked at her,
and handed the manuscript across the desk, saying:
"Please read it."</p>

<p>She obeyed, and when she was through, said: "It is
a nice eulogy," and then her face showed the wonderment
because of his expression of a moment ago.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "it <i>is</i> nice, but take a glance at
this," and forthwith drew from the top of the desk, a
pamphlet with the picture of an attractive colored girl
thereon.</p>

<p>Mildred observed the picture, and then read the
article on the other three pages. When she saw the
editor's face again, she understood, but she didn't say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
in fact, she didn't know what to say. The editor continued:</p>

<p>"These pamphlets are scattered all over town. Can
you imagine a person with her appearance and obvious
intelligence doing such a thing? And yet, this office is
the recipient of many such instances."</p>

<p>The article had been copied from the three pages of
the pamphlet he had handed her, and which were scattered
all over the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Woman With the Three Moles</i></p>


<p>She was now in the creole city. Before her lay the
wide street that Sidney Wyeth had followed; but it was
lighted by the sun, for she had arrived in the morning,
whereas, he had come at night. She traveled with only
a handbag to encumber her, and, therefore, did not take
a car, but walked leisurely up the broad highway.</p>

<p>The street, she at once observed, was very wide; it
was so wide that the buildings appeared very low that
lined the sides. She counted the stories of one building,
and found that it was not the wide street alone, for the
buildings were not high after all, not nearly so high as
any of the towns in which she had been. She wondered
why they were not; and, of course, it did not occur to
her, that the city was built over water that was only a
few inches from the surface, and which, in fact, seeped
and stood upon the top whenever it could. Keeping the
water below the surface, in short, had been this city's
problem ever since its location. And it is no wonder,
for, if anyone takes notice, the water of the mighty
river (that makes it possible as a port and encircles it
largely) is very often above the town. At several times
in the history of this city's existence, these waters have
become so high, that they threatened for days to spill
over, and, therefore, submerge all the city in a few
minutes. But our story is not concerned with the possible
submerging of the town; we are concerned in
following Mildred Latham, as she walked curiously up
one side of one of its broad highways.</p>

<p>She wondered, as had Sidney Wyeth&mdash;and as perhaps
anyone else given to observation would wonder&mdash;that it
should build some streets so wide, and at the same time
make others so narrow that they were not adequate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
an alley. The buildings, as she saw them, with few
exceptions, were old; only a few had, apparently, been
erected in the past ten years; while over most of the
sidewalks were sheds.</p>

<p>As she continued her indefinite wandering, she observed
many curiosities, not to be seen in other cities. "But, of
course," she murmured, "this is the creole city, and is
known to be much more historical than the rest of our
country."</p>

<p>There are not so many colored people encountered on
the streets as in other southern towns; although, viewing
its last census of five years before, there should be
now not less than one hundred thousand of that race
within its limits. She saw many, however, and looked at
them curiously. Here and there was one that looked
like a creole; while most of them, were the usual kind.</p>

<p>Never had she seen so many cars on one street, as she
saw on the four tracks that ran down the middle of this
one. They were arranged with a curbing to protect, or
keep slim-footed mules out of their way, so they had to
avoid the pedestrians only. Many police protected at
every intersection; but withal, she was nervous as she
hurried across, at the beckon of one who wore the bluest
uniform, and a white hat&mdash;no, it was a helmet.</p>

<p>She had arrived at Basin court, and did not know that
she was within a few doors of the man she loved. She
gazed about for a time, and then went on her way.
She came, presently, abreast of a man&mdash;a colored man&mdash;and
he was neat looking and intelligent. She paused
with some constraint, and said:</p>

<p>"Could you advise me, Mister, where I could secure
lodging? I am a stranger, and&mdash;I do not know where
to go."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly for a moment. Then his eyes
glanced away and down a street that intersected. On
either side of that street were houses&mdash;small houses that
made a specialty of a room to the front, and these rooms
contained&mdash;but we have not come to that. And then
he looked at her again.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered back down that other street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
he thought for a moment. He looked at her again, and
then spoke. This girl might be stalling&mdash;so many of
them did&mdash;but still she was intelligent, and that made
a difference.</p>

<p>"I could not, Madam, I regret to say, for I do not
live on this side. My home is in Tunis, which is across
the river. That is why I do not know."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, and her tone was sorry, "you do not
live on this side?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. You are a stranger here?" He eyed her
keenly again.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I have just arrived," and she told him also,
that she sold books.</p>

<p>Her tone was pleasant; her words were correct; and
she said them in such a way that he forgot his suspicion,
and then showed her forthwith much courtesy.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he commented. "I wish I knew a place;
but I am not so often on this side, for I am a physician,
and my duties keep me mostly over there; but if you
had happened to be wishing to stop over there, I could
place you." She thought quickly.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth was on this side, undoubtedly. She
might at any time encounter him. And she didn't know
why, since that was what she had hoped for; but she
rather feared to encounter him right now. She had no
room or place to go, and, as she meditated, she could not
see any reason why she should not as soon be on the
other side as on this. She liked quietness. So she said:</p>

<p>"I had not decided whether I would stay across the
river or here, though, of course, I expected to stay on
this side. I would, however, as soon be on the other
side, I think."</p>

<p>"In that event, then," said he, "you can accompany
me home, for my wife&mdash;we are recently married and she
is a stranger and would be glad of companionship&mdash;has a
room, and it is for rent. So, when you have seen it, and
in case you are satisfied, you could have it. The charge,
I think, furnished, is seven dollars a month."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," she said, and was beside him.
"I am sure I shall be satisfied."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said he, "I am going over now, so if
you are agreeable, we will catch a ferry forthwith."</p>

<p>They now walked back down the broad highway, at
the end of which could be seen the stacks of many
steamers. He pointed out, very kindly, sights of interest
and explained them.</p>

<p>"Now, here," he said, "is a store. The family who
own it are rich, as rich as any in the city, and it is said
they are part Negro; though, of course, they do not
admit it. The city, you will find, is a historical old place
in many instances." And as they walked down the
broad highway, he told her a great deal that was so
interesting, that it made the distance which had seemed
a long way an hour before, appear real short. They went
up to the river, and boarded a ferry.</p>

<p>It was a nice ride to the other shore. Once in the
middle of the river, which was very wide at this point,
the creole city rose and stood outlined in all its splendor.
The waters near either shore were decorated with many
river steamers, and as many, if not more, ocean liners.
Great docks, grim and dark, opened their roller doors
along the banks; while the steamers before them swung
great loads of freight in their cellars.</p>

<p>"Miss Latham," said the doctor, when they had arrived
at the house, "this is my wife, Mrs. Winnie Jacques."</p>

<p>They greeted each other, and murmured many words,
and, when the introduction was over, Mrs. Jacques
turned and asked Mildred to follow her. As she did so,
upon her neck, which rose above the loose kimono she wore,
was a mole; to the right of it another. Almost midway
between the two, but an inch below, was another. And
now Mildred Latham gave a start, then she swallowed
hard. <i>Where had she seen the moles before</i>&mdash;the three
moles? Only one person in the world, she was sure,
possessed them. She followed the other to a room, and
that night she didn't sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning she kissed the other, before she left,
but Mrs. Jacques didn't know why. But she watched
her strangely, as she walked toward the ferry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Hello, Brown Skin!</i>"</p>


<p>He came abreast of a depot; it was new, with an imposing
front, over which was inscribed TERMINAL
STATION in arched letters. It seemed quite a long
way back to the colored waiting room, and the station
was very narrow. It ran back several hundred feet,
where four or five tracks received the incoming and outgoing
human traffic. The station, like the one he had
come into a short while ago, was filled with men and
women, obviously idlers. He lingered only a few minutes,
when curiosity led him further. He left the station from
the side entrance, and found himself upon a very narrow
street. He paused, and as he did so, strains of ragtime
music came to his ears. He was curious to see where it
came from, and to hear it closer. He crossed the street,
and found that it came from a place&mdash;a cabaret&mdash;but for
white people only. He turned away and went down the
street, where something odd caught his attention.</p>

<p>He stood where the walks intersected, and gazed to
his left. Yes, it was a <i>feature</i>. On either side of the
street stood a row of one-story houses. Lights were
bright, as bright as day, on either side, which fact filled
the narrow street with light also. He passed down one
side; and there were multitudes of men sauntering, as
he was&mdash;but there were no women, excepting in the one-story
houses. They stood behind open doors, some of
them, while others sat in chairs before a grate fire;
but one and all, he noted, were thinly dressed and smiled
on everybody&mdash;but himself (for, you see, they were white
women)&mdash;with amorous eyes.</p>

<p>"Come here dearie," said one&mdash;and many others said
the same. "I have something to tell you." "Indeed,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
he conjectured, "but secrets appear to be the fashion
here."</p>

<p>He walked to the end of that block, and where that
street intersected with another. And before him, on
eight different sides, was a myriad of the same. Women,
thinly clad&mdash;and it, you understand, was the month of
January....</p>

<p>It was a sight to be indulged; a pastime that was
diverting, to say the least. And, since so very many
others&mdash;men&mdash;were seeing it, why then not he?</p>

<p>He saw it&mdash;at least a large part of it.</p>

<p>He strolled another block, and the same sight met his
eye; but, as he got further away from the station, the
lights grew dimmer; the women fewer, but plenty, at
any rate.</p>

<p>Now he had reached a place where the crowds had not
penetrated&mdash;only stragglers lingered like himself&mdash;and
where the women were of another race, for now they
were colored.</p>

<p>"Hello, Brown Skin," they greeted him, and he smiled
back, but didn't stop&mdash;not even to hear the secret that
almost everyone had to tell him.</p>

<p>"You are sure some brown, kid. Just come here a
moment. Don't be afraid, I won't eat you."</p>

<p>"Indeed," he said to one who was very small, and could
smile with more effect than the others. "But I'm afraid."
And he laughed aloud as he went upon his way.</p>

<p>He had stopped now. He had to; for, before him was
a brick wall&mdash;no, a brick fence. It was painted white
and was about eight or ten feet high; while inside raised
something sinister. "Gee!" he exclaimed. "But that
is a sight one does not appreciate."</p>

<p>He turned now, and passed down a side street, which
was occupied by the same. But he couldn't forget what
stood grim and determined on the other side. It had
been there a long time too&mdash;before, oh, long before these
women had. Yes, and it would be there long after they
had passed away, and others, not yet born, had come to
take their places. And as he passed down the street,
under the subtlety of those night smiles, that place seemed
to say&mdash;kept on saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>"Play on she cats! Oh, play on! Hell's got your
soul; but I'll have the rest by and by." He turned the
next corner and walked another block, and lo! There
stood another! "Kick high little girl; sin as you please;
Hell's got your hearts, but I'll have what's left&mdash;I won't
say how soon...."</p>

<p>"The devil!" he exclaimed. "This is the worst place
for cemeteries I ever knew. I'm going away from here,
to my room." And he went.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Where do the wealthiest of the wealthy white people
live?" he inquired the next morning, when he had
arisen, and dined at one of the Chinese cafes.</p>

<p>The others regarded him now with a question in their
eyes. "Yes," he repeated, "where do they live, for it is
to their servants I prefer to try to sell the book, for which
I am agent."</p>

<p>They caught his logic then, and replied:</p>

<p>"Take a car at the next corner, ride until you come to
a park that is called d'Ubberville. There you unload,
and find yourself in the midst of the wealthiest of the
wealthy."</p>

<p>He went down to that street, which was the aforementioned
wide street. All that money could buy, was
on sale along its broad highway. He sought a bookstore,
where he wished to make inquiries, and, of course,
found a number. He strolled about, making inquiries,
until his watch said it was time to return, and go forth
in quest of that part of town, where he wished to begin
his work.</p>

<p>It was certainly a long way to his destination. Indeed,
he made inquiries of the conductor, until that one told
him he would tell him when they arrived at the place
where he wanted to stop. So, he sat in patience after
that. He allowed his eyes to feast upon the splendor
and magnificence of the beautiful buildings. Yes, they
were elegant homes; they were the finest homes; and
they were beautifully arranged, not to say artistically,
on either side of the street, which, while not the same,
was another one just as wide. So wide, indeed, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
middle was converted into a lawn, on which many palms
reared their graceful foliage.</p>

<p>"The creole city," he murmured. "For a long time
I have wished to see it as it really is; to know the people
and to learn of the many things and wonders it is said to
contain."</p>

<p>"Here you are," said the conductor at last, and Sidney
Wyeth alighted at once.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he exclaimed, standing entranced, as he
looked all about him. "<i>Such</i> homes; <i>such</i> trees&mdash;such
<i>everything</i>." And then he walked in the direction his
face happened to be turned. He was slightly nervous
for a time, but presently, with a bold front, he turned
into the most insignificant of the many houses, and
rapped quietly at the back door.</p>

<p>"Come in," someone called, and he knew the voice
belonged to one of his race. He had many times thought
it strange, but it was always easy to determine the Negro
by his voice alone.</p>

<p>He entered, and looked at the owner of that same voice.
She was a stout, brown-skinned woman; and there was
another also, but she was black. One, the large woman,
was the cook, for she worked over the stove, while the
other was obviously the washer-woman, for she was
ironing.</p>

<p>In his talk, he told the story of the book, and filled
them with enthusiasm, to a point that both subscribed.
He said he was just commencing, and was glad they had
favored him with an order. He thanked them again,
and, turning, he left and betook himself across the street,
where he encountered another brown-skinned woman, but
she failed to buy. And the excuse she gave for not
doing so, was one he always regarded. She was not
able&mdash;having other irons in the fire. He left her, went
across the street on another corner, and entered the rear
of the smallest house he saw on the street. He was
turning to go, when another brown-skinned woman put
in her appearance. She was beautiful, he thought. And
she could smile until he&mdash;well, she smiled. She said
she'd take one, to be sure, so he wrote down her name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
and asked her about herself. She was married, and
laughed tantalizingly, though he had not asked her that.
He left presently, by the way he had entered, and went
to another house, and still to another, until the watch
said five; then he betook himself to a car line. It was
not the one he had come out on, and soon he saw other
homes, which showed the creole element.</p>

<p>That night he went rambling; he couldn't seem to be
still. There was so much to be seen, and it had a peculiar
fascination for him. He went in the direction he had
gone the night before, and met crowds of people. He
strolled until gay music arrested his attention. About
an electric entrance, from which the music came, stood
colored men. He got a peep inside, as some one entered,
and saw that the occupants were Negroes, so he entered.</p>

<p>A waiter showed him a seat by a table. Around the
room were plenty of others; there were women and men,
and others came and went all the time. The music had
ceased when he entered; but, 'ere long, it struck up,
and the room was filled with the strains. Couples arose
and stood face to face, and did what he had never seen,
as he recalled. The music played was a two-step; but they
did not two-step&mdash;at least not the way he had done it
years before. They made only one step where he had
made two. Across the table from where he sat, a girl
smiled upon him invitingly, as much as to say: "Let's
dance!" He was tempted, and then he recalled that they
had begun this dance since he had quit some years
before. So he kept his seat, and she smiled upon another.
He escorted her, and they joined the dancers. A hesitation,
they called it, and he was positive he would&mdash;could
never learn it.</p>

<p>Presently the music stopped, and the couple returned
to their seat.</p>

<p>"I know you are going to buy me a little drink," she
said, whereupon the man said "nix" and left. She
glared after him, and called him "cheap."</p>

<p>Wyeth was glad now he had kept his seat. He didn't
like bold women, even in a cabaret, and this was the
first one he had ever entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a place for amusements, he soon saw, for, between
dances came songs by many girls and a man or two,
while clever dancing and "ballin' the jack" was a feature;
and it attracted to the performers many nickels, that
they did not hesitate to pick up 'ere they had fallen, and
"balled" again and again, until it seemed their legs
must sure be tired; but you see, they were accustomed
to that.</p>

<p>"Some town," he said to himself, when he took his
leave. "A good place to forget, to live?" Well, it
seemed that way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_SIX_4" id="CHAPTER_SIX_4"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="center"><i>"Who're You!" She Repeated</i></p>


<p>And now we arrive at the end of the pilgrimage of
Sidney Wyeth. He had ceased his critical observations,
and had secured a room on the fifth floor of an office
building, that was owned and controlled by a Negro
lodge. He began an effort toward the distribution of his
work, that he believed would be successful now, since
he had learned, by contact, the art of reaching his people.</p>

<p>He placed a large desk in the office, and put a carpet
on the floor; a large table for wrapping purposes to one
side, while upon the door and the windows he had an
artist painter inscribe the letters:</p>

<p class="center">CRESENT DISTRIBUTORS COMPANY</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, "if I can induce someone, here
and there, to go to the people and follow the instructions
I will cheerfully give, I think <i>The Tempest</i> will be placed
into the hands of many people. And to that end, I shall
bend all my energy."</p>

<p>And thus he began work permanently. He decided to
canvass every afternoon, and to attend to the office and
correspondence in the mornings, until such a time, when
it would not be necessary to do so.</p>

<p>He filled the country again with circular letters; but
before he had completed this task, he felt an illness pervading
his usual healthy physique. "Biliousness," he
said. "It'll be over in a few days," and he went to work
much harder, in an effort to forget it.</p>

<p>For days he held it in check by the effort he put forth.
But, as the days came and went, it became harder. He
didn't go to a physician, but waited. But before many
days had passed, however, he became conscious that it
was more serious. So there came a day when he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
strangely sick; when he laid down, everything about him
swam; he felt dizzy, but withal, he kept up the fight.</p>

<p>"I won't give up to it, I won't!" he declared. And
he earnestly tried to overcome it.</p>

<p>He arose from his desk, and, despite the fact that his
knees trembled and his whole frame quivered, he went
into the street. He felt a mad desire to see this city,
although he had been seeing it every day. So, to the
wide street he went, and boarded a car that took him
around a belt. It brought him back to where he had
entered, and the route was twelve miles long. It led him
through the district where he canvassed, and which was
occupied by the richest. He saw their magnificent homes
this time, strangely. At times his eyes would close,
despite his effort to keep them open. And then, when
he awoke, it was with a nervous start, and he was surprised
each time, to find himself aboard the large cars
that thundered along between rows of the finest houses
in the city.</p>

<p>He could not interest himself in them now; they
appeared dull and without life. The car came down,
and went through the business district before it came
back again into the wide street. He got off, and almost
fell in doing so. He stood for a time, at a loss to control
himself. He wouldn't go to bed, that was sure; but
where to go, he could not think for a time. Then it
occurred to him to see that place&mdash;that place where a
thousand and more women, vandals, were hurrying life
to its end.</p>

<p>So he walked in that direction, reeling at times, until
some regarded him as if he were drunk. He passed
down a street that was called Bienville. In that neighborhood
it was the broad highway. And it was crowded.
It was then about nine o'clock, and the sidewalks were
filled. The girls were merry&mdash;they were always merry,
apparently.... They called to him as before, that is, a
part of them. The others&mdash;well, the color line was
drawn here too, and white men came first.</p>

<p>"Hello, Brown Skin," smiled one he had not seen before,
and winked. He regarded her for a moment strangely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
She took it as an evidence of encouragement. She
beckoned to him vigorously, and <i>promised</i> so very much.
He turned, and before him rose one of the ghostly, silent
places&mdash;the cemetery. It aroused him, for a time, from
his apparent lethargy. He looked at it, and thought
how strange it was this city had so many. And they
were always silent&mdash;waiting, waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>He shuddered and moved away from it, and in a
direction that he had not been. On all sides the girls
were gay that night. He went around a block, ignoring
invitations. His brain was clear for awhile, and he
thought: "Who located such a place?" A place where
each day someone died and went to hell! But, as he
thought the more, he concluded that dying was not
necessary. It was a living death....</p>

<p>"Come in, Brown Skin, not a man has been here tonight."
He looked up, and in the doorway stood a
woman. She was tall and slender, and brown. She
smiled with an effort, he could see, for, in truth, the
woman was hungry.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," she faltered, "and that's on the square.
The landlord took every dime I made last night, for rent
this morning. Not a bite have I eaten this day. Every
day he calls early for his rent. Business is rotten&mdash;everybody's
broke; but he must have his rent, or out into
the street I go." She paused and looked tired, and
then went on: "I'm so weak. I'd slip out of this hell
hole, and try to make an honest living, but I have
no clothes, and besides, I'm afraid that while I was
gone, he might come along and turn the lock, and carry
the key with him. And too, the bulls are filling the
streets tonight, and fly cops are everywhere. So I
might be arrested, and go t' jail. I don't like that place
up there." And she sighed a long drawn, weary sigh.</p>

<p>"Why would you be arrested?" he inquired, speaking
for the first time.</p>

<p>"Why would I be arrested?" she exclaimed. "You
must not know the rules of this district," she cried.
"Why, we are not allowed to leave it. When we enter
this, we agree to stay!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>"To stay?" he echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "To stay...." He followed her
gaze. She was not aware of what she saw, no doubt;
but he was. Before her gaze rose gray, grim and sinister,
one of those places&mdash;the abode of dead things. Yes,
and it was waiting, silently waiting. He turned and
regarded the woman. She was quiet. A man came by
crying:</p>

<p>"Hot sandwiches&mdash;hot tamales&mdash;five cents apiece!"</p>

<p>He saw her gazing at them with eyes that were dry,
but hungry.</p>

<p>"Here," he cried, "with your sandwiches." And then
turned to her:</p>

<p>"Take as many as you want. All you can eat tonight,
and some for tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Her eyes widened. She beheld him now with wonder.
"Do you mean it?" she whispered, in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>He nodded, and handed the man a half dollar.</p>

<p>She ate ravenously, while he watched. Presently he
started, while she watched him strangely, as if he were
something unearthly. He turned suddenly, and came back
to where she stood. He ran his hand into his pocket,
and drew forth three silver dollars. "Here," he said, and
a moment later he was gone.</p>

<p>She stood transformed, and then, dreamlike, she cried
after him:</p>

<p>"God bless you!"</p>

<p>Back toward his room he now walked, and at times
stumbled. But all the way the words of that woman
rang in his ears: "God bless you!" "God," he murmured,
"do You know these people? Are You acquainted
with these women who are sinning? They don't know
You! Their souls are burning now in hell!" He didn't
know the direction he was going, nor did he hear the
invitations; but soon he came to one of those walls, and
looked up. Yes, they were inside.... Those who had
known this life in the infinite long ago. And they were
waiting for those others....</p>

<p>"Brown Skin," he now heard, and then much gayety
followed; but he looked up and saw the others, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
were likewise waiting. "Sin on little girl. Satan's got
your soul, and you'll burn in hell some day."</p>

<p>He went a block where, on one side the gray silence
greeted him, while on the other gay life was the order.</p>

<p>"Come in boy, I've something to tell you." But
Sidney Wyeth made no answer; all the while he could
feel that silent spectre, the grave. And it seemed to say:
"We are waiting, waiting, waiting."</p>

<p>He went now in the direction of his room, and as he
went along, the gray court kept telling him: "These are
mine&mdash;all of them. And, do you know, they come to me
each day. Oh, they are gay&mdash;now! The devil's got
their souls, but I always get the rest. Meanwhile I am
waiting, patiently waiting."</p>

<p>Gay music came from the doors of a cabaret, and he
saw it was for colored people. White people were not
allowed within. He entered. The accustomed crowd
lined the walls. The same girls came each night&mdash;he now
saw. They welcomed those who wished for drinks,
which came at fifteen cents apiece; a half of which
they received at the end of the night, and that was how
they lived.</p>

<p>He avoided them. On the floor were the dancers.
The music was inspiring, and "balling the jack" was the
order. A rain of nickels came down upon them, and they
quit only when they were exhausted.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a waiter, at the table where he
had fallen asleep. So he ordered a drink, gulped it down
with an effort, and took his leave. He emerged, and had
walked a few steps, when someone touched him. He
looked down into the face of the woman who had been
hungry.</p>

<p>"Who're you?" she said. "<i>Who're you?</i>" she repeated,
"to feed a starving wench and ask nothing. Don't look
at me so strangely. I followed you. I saw you enter there.
I would have followed you in; but they don't allow <i>us</i>
in there.... They don't allow us anywhere but&mdash;oh, well,
I didn't come to tell you my troubles. And then," she
added, "I wouldn't wish to disgrace you by having
others see; but won't you come back?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>He gazed down into her eyes and saw the truth therein.
"A lost soul.... Yes, a lost soul." And then something
within him seemed to burst. The world about him
became a maze of darkness, and he knew no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ernestine Jacques very soon became devoted to
her roomer, Mildred Latham. She told her husband as
much when she had been in the house a few days.</p>

<p>"She's a delightful girl, a fine companion, and I am
glad she made inquiry of you in regard to lodging."</p>

<p>"I am pleased to hear it," said her husband. "I am
glad to have found you a companion, and now you won't
miss me so much, will you?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I will," she pouted. "I didn't mean that,"
she said. "But women, you know, seem to require
friends, even when they have the best husbands in the
world."</p>

<p>We leave them at this point, and return to the subject
of their conversation, who had begun a canvass in the
sale of Wyeth's book, and had met with success, which is
neither unusual nor strange, since it depends upon the
efforts of the worker.</p>

<p>She estimated that he would confine his work to the
aristocratic section, where the multitude of servants
were, so she decided to try the colored people in their
homes, to begin with. Therefore, from one she learned
of others, until she had a list of people whom she worked
among, and with excellent results. She became an
attendant of the Methodist church, where she met
many, and made acquaintances that increased the success
of her work. And thus her life flowed serenely along,
uneventful for many weeks. But she had not seen or
heard of the one she sought, although, in the course of
time, she came across the book, and knew it had been
bought from him.</p>

<p>It rained at times, until whole days were lost, for it
was too wet to enter nice homes. She stayed in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
room at these times, and talked with Mrs. Jacques as
little as possible, although she longed to do so very
much. She was glad to see, as the time went on, that
the two were devoted to each other. Dr. Jacques was a
good man, and was even a better husband.</p>

<p>"Some day," she sighed, "maybe I'll be like that."
She pondered now for some time.</p>

<p>Mildred had reached no decision, as yet, in regard to
her plans. She was nervous, at times, on the street,
fearing she might meet Sidney. She worked hard to
occupy herself, and thus it went along, until she had
gotten her work well under way.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been up in the Perier building?"
a lawyer, who purchased a book, inquired of her.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not. Where is that, and are there
colored people about it?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. It is a building occupied and owned by
Negroes. There are a great many people located in it
who would buy the book, I am sure," he informed her.
"I would advise you to go."</p>

<p>"I thank you ever so much, indeed," she cried gratefully.
"I shall go there tomorrow."</p>

<p>The next day was a beautiful one; the air was fragrant
with the perfume of roses, and the birds sang, seemingly,
everywhere.</p>

<p>"A storm of some proportion will reach this place
before night," said Dr. Jacques. "A day that begins as
this one, always ends that way!"</p>

<p>"My husband is a weather prognosticator," commented
his wife, humorously. Mildred smiled knowingly
from across the table.</p>

<p>"And you have been very successful with your work,
Miss Latham?" said he, surveying her appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, very much so. But it has been so elsewhere."
She told him of her work in the city she had just left.</p>

<p>"It was a strange coincidence," said he, "how they
came to secure the Y.M.C.A. in that town. I keep
myself pretty well informed regarding uplift among our
people, and it was truly a delight when I read, that, at
almost the last minute, money that was lacking, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
necessary to fulfil the requirements, was brought to
hand.</p>

<p>"It was too bad Grantville failed in the effort to secure
theirs. And they wanted it so badly," the doctor continued.
"I attended school in that city, and always have
a warm spot in my heart for the place."</p>

<p>"Well, dear," said his wife, "how did they come to
fail in the effort in Grantville, and succeeded in this
other town? I understood you to say that Grantville
had a much more intelligent set of colored people, and
more progressive."</p>

<p>"So it has! So it has!" he said quickly; "but by
some strange coincidence, the money necessary to complete
the arrangement, was brought forward at almost
the last minute. Otherwise, they had acknowledged
failure."</p>

<p>"I wonder where the money came from?" she mused.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must be going about my work," said
Mildred, rising. "I am going to canvass the Perier
building today. I have been told there are many offices
occupied by persons who might buy."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," said the doctor. "There are many
I am sure." He was thoughtful a moment, and then
continued: "Our people in this town are not possessed
with that race spirit which it is claimed Negroes have in
other cities. They are accused of lacking unity; but,
in spite of that, when one applies himself to the task
with patience and fortitude, enough of the spirit can be
aroused to make work like yours remunerative. But,
nevertheless, I am often distressed when I realize, that
we haven't a first class local race paper here; for, without
one, it is impossible to reach the people&mdash;the colored
people&mdash;through advertising, unless a high rate is paid
in the columns of the white paper, and that is not
practical."</p>

<p>"Are you much acquainted in the building?" Mildred
inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know everybody&mdash;that is, almost everybody.
The last time I was over there, I observed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
an office had been taken by one who is a stranger to me;
and I observed, also, that he appeared to be studious,
so it might be worth while to see him too."</p>

<p>She thanked him, kissed his wife, and a few minutes
later, her steps died away in the distance.</p>

<p>"Dear," said Mrs. Jacques, "don't you know that
she reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
But who it was, where it was, I do not know; but I
always feel queer when she kisses me."</p>

<p>"You're becoming fanciful," he smiled, lighting a
cigar.</p>

<p>They talked about other subjects, and Mildred was,
for the time, forgotten.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"A story of the northwest, by a Negro pioneer, eh?"
said a man, upon whose office door was written: <i>Real
Estate, Loans and Renting</i>. "M-m. Looks like a good
book. Negroes don't write many books, although there
are a great many that come the rounds about Negroes,
but gotten up by whites with a sketch about Tom, Dick
and Harry, and exaggerated estimates of the Negro.
So, in view of the fact, I guess you may put me down
for a copy, and deliver it next week."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," she said, as she wrote his name,
and the date of delivery.</p>

<p>"Having much success?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"A great deal, I am glad to say," she replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear that. There are always readers to be
found, if one looks for them; but, on the whole, the
people of this town have not much of a literary turn of
mind."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"No, it is such a care-free, happy-go-lucky place, that
not all the people who should, try to concentrate themselves
in reading." He was quiet and thoughtful for a
moment, and then said: "Have you tried many of the
school teachers?"</p>

<p>"A great many," she said.</p>

<p>"And how did you find them?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, just fair. I sold to a few of them."</p>

<p>"A few of them, eh! It would seem they should
welcome the fact that Negroes are beginning to write
books."</p>

<p>"Obviously, yes."</p>

<p>"And the preachers?"</p>

<p>"They buy; but some of them dislike to, so much so,
that I have dispensed with going to them."</p>

<p>"And the physicians?"</p>

<p>"They are very nice." She didn't say how nice, and
he didn't ask, so it ended there.</p>

<p>She went from one office to another, and almost all
purchased. Some out of real interest, while others subscribed
merely through courtesy to her, and from the
fact that it was rare to meet colored people selling, or
trying to sell anything.</p>

<p>She had completed the third floor, and was ascending
to the fourth, when the then overcast skies became
darker and rain began falling fitfully. She made all the
offices on that floor with her usual success, and started
upon the fifth. Twilight was gathering, and, with the
darkness from the clouds, lights were soon aglow.</p>

<p>She had made the fifth and was just passing to the
elevator, when she chanced to spy an office that she had
overlooked, and, in that moment, she recalled the doctor's
statement about the stranger. The office was at the
end of the hall&mdash;a hall that was not much used, evidently.
Mildred observed, as she approached, that the door was
slightly ajar. She knocked lightly, and then, receiving
no invitation, pushed the door open and entered.</p>

<p>A man sat at the other side of the room, and he seemed
to be sick, or asleep&mdash;at least he lay with face downward
across the desk, at which he sat. She approached
him, disregarding his apparent lethargy, and when she
had offered a greeting, and he had raised himself slightly,
she told him the story of the book.</p>

<p>He was sick, she soon saw, and she felt sympathetic.
She bathed his head&mdash;his forehead&mdash;with a damp towel;
then she inquired if he felt better, and looked for the
first time into his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last, oh Lord, at last!" she cried, in a subdued
voice, as she bounded down the steps. "I have found
him, I have found him!" She walked hurriedly on her
way to the street, and did not wait or think of the elevator
that would have saved her strength. When she was on
the street, she hurried through the rain&mdash;for it was
pouring now&mdash;and did not stop until the ferry had been
reached.</p>

<p>Once aboard this, she hid herself in the darkest place
she could find, and there, as the paddle of the propeller
came to her ears, she cried: "Sidney, my Sidney, I have
found you. And never, never, until the end of the
world will I be far from you&mdash;Oh, my love!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>"Typhoid-pneumonia," said the physician, rising from
over the patient, who had just been brought to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Sidney Wyeth, unconscious, was carried at once to the
section of the great hospital reserved for patients with
contagious diseases.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, doctor? Is it a serious
case, or just a light attack?" inquired one of the assistants,
who was making a specialty of a study of fever.</p>

<p>"Serious," was the reply, "very serious. He will be
lucky if he is able to pull through."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I just missed you, Miss Latham," said Dr. Jacques,
coming in a few minutes after Mildred had entered the
house.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am sorry! We could have come over
together," she exclaimed, smothering her excitement for
the time, and smiling regretfully, when he had told her
that he was in the Perier building just before she left.</p>

<p>"Were you very successful with the people in the
building?" he inquired pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I received eleven orders there today."</p>

<p>"Too bad the young man, the stranger, took sick.
You might have gotten a dozen," he said.</p>

<p>"Who took sick?" she inquired, with a start.</p>

<p>"The young man I spoke to you about this morning,"
explained the physician. "He was carried from the
building shortly after you left, with a serious attack of
typhoid-pneumonia." He was standing with his back
to her when he said this, and, therefore, did not see her
start and open her mouth. She swallowed the exclamation,
and he was no wiser. Hurrying to her room, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
entered, locked the door, and sat down with a wild look
in her eyes, plainly frightened.</p>

<p>"Sick," she mumbled. "Typhoid-pneumonia. Oh,
merciful God!" She was silent then for a long time.
Outside, the rain continued to fall, while in the other
rooms she could hear Mrs. Jacques singing softly, as she
busied herself in the preparation of the evening meal.</p>

<p>"If I had only known," Mildred whispered to herself.
And then she was compelled to dismiss what she was
thinking of, as being impractical. She continued to sit
and meditate, until she was called to supper by Ernestine.
She arose and bathed her face, realizing it would be advisable
to appear unconcerned, for, as she now estimated,
she would dislike to be questioned.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, she inquired of the physician
where the patient had been taken.</p>

<p>"To the charity hospital," he replied.</p>

<p>"I see," she said calmly. "Is that a good place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the best in the south. The Sisters of Mercy have
it largely in charge, and they give the best possible care
to all patients&mdash;black or white."</p>

<p>She went to her room, slightly relieved, and fell at
once to planning.</p>

<p>The fact that he had taken an office, was self-evident
that he was preparing some extensive campaign with
regard to his book. As it stood now, whatever he had
been arranging would stop at once.</p>

<p>It was late that evening when she retired. But,
before sleep came to her eyes that night, she had decided
upon a course of action.</p>

<p>Mildred arose early, dressed, heated some tea, and ate
a light lunch. Then she threw on a dress, hurried out of
the house and down to the ferry. An hour later, she was
at the hospital.</p>

<p>"I called, beg pardon," she began, "to inquire about
a patient who was brought here last evening, and who,
I understand, was stricken with typhoid-pneumonia.
His name is Sidney Wyeth, and he is a colored man."</p>

<p>After a moment, in which the record was consulted,
the informant turned to her and said: "Sidney Wyeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
a colored man, serious attack of typhoid-pneumonia. In
the ward of contagious diseases. Cannot be seen, Madam,
I regret to say."</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;ah,&mdash;did you say&mdash;it&mdash;was&mdash;quite serious?"
she inquired, tremulously.</p>

<p>"Quite serious, Madam. Quite serious."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt, however&mdash;ah, that he will recover?"</p>

<p>"We are not allowed to give out information of that
nature. He may recover, and still he may not; but we
cannot say."</p>

<p>"Just another question, sir," she said hesitatingly.
"About how long would it be, in case he should recover,
before he will likely be on the street?"</p>

<p>"Cases as serious, and of that nature, rarely leave the
hospital under two months, possibly three, and sometimes
it is even four; but, if he should recover, it would
not be possible under two months."</p>

<p>"Very well, I thank you," and, bowing, she left the
desk.</p>

<p>Mildred walked down the wide street upon which the
hospital faced. She had not consulted any one else, and
in truth, had no idea that the disease would last so long.</p>

<p>"What can I do, what can I do?" she asked herself
several times, as she passed down the street. "He has
just started up, and to think that such a misfortune
should overtake him at the outset."</p>

<p>She walked on down the street, until she arrived at
the corner, where she paused for a moment. She turned,
and only a block away rose the Perier building. She
could see his office. It was toward the rear, and, as she
stood looking up at it meditatively, she caught an outline
of the desk at which he had sat, when she came
into the office, with no thought that she was near him.</p>

<p>"I am going up there, to the custodian of that building,
and&mdash;well, I'm going," and she went.</p>

<p>"Are you the custodian of the building, sir?" she
inquired a few minutes later, of an elderly man with a
pointed beard and cleverly trimmed mustache.</p>

<p>"I am, Madam," he replied. "And at your service."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>"A gentleman, who has recently taken an office here,
was yesterday stricken with typhoid-pneumonia, and
was taken to the charity hospital."</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam, so he was," acknowledged the other.
"Too bad. He took the office only a short time ago,
and seemed to be a very progressive young man. You
are acquainted with him?" he asked, observing the
worried look upon her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am acquainted with him."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I suppose you are a relative or a close
friend," he said, and then paused before proceeding.
"His office is open&mdash;that is, no one is there to attend to
it, and he seems to be the recipient of considerable mail,
I have observed. So, if you are interested in his affairs,
you may have the key and look after the matter, if you
wish too." He was very cordial, and the fact saved her
from explaining what she had in view when she entered.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I am interested in his affairs, and
it is very kind of you to make the suggestion. In truth,
it was on his account that I called here. I should be
glad to look after his business while he is indisposed,"
she ended bravely and kept her face straight.</p>

<p>The custodian gave her the keys, and a few minutes
later, she found herself in the small office, looking curiously
and guiltily about.</p>

<p>She assorted the mail, and then, going through
what had been opened, she soon got an idea of his plans.
Being engaged in this same work, it was easy for her to
collect the broken threads, and resume his task. She
carefully opened the mail that had come that day, and,
a moment later, was typing replies to a score or more,
in the manner he would have done, had providence
given him the opportunity.</p>

<p>She worked late that evening, and neglected to canvass
at all, although it was a beautiful day.</p>

<p>She saw, by the copy in one of the drawers, that he
was advertising for agents, and in an apparently successful
way. Now, it had occurred to her before, that white
people preyed upon Negroes as agents, and, moreover,
from her own experience, she had come to realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
they would (white agents) attempt to sell anything, if
inducements were made that seemed plausible.</p>

<p>When she was in her room alone that night, she did
some more planning, some figuring, and some estimating.
In the end, she decided to take the risk.</p>

<p>Being a business woman had always appealed to her
fancy, and the work was, to her, a most absorbing
diversion. She had learned how to operate a typewriter
when she attended school, and was very clever at shorthand
also, could keep books with proficiency, and was
now glad she had learned these things, although, until
she had taken up the sale of the book, she had had no
occasion to use her ability.</p>

<p>The following day, she arrived at the office at eight
o'clock sharp, and went to work at once. When the mail
came, she was cheered to receive twenty dollars in the
same, and also, to note three orders from agents, who
were selling the book in other cities. She attended to
all this, the packing and shipping of the books, wrote
replies to all letters, including some of encouragement to
those who were succeeding.</p>

<p>She had lunch at a nearby cafe, and returned to
work immediately. She then made up a list of carbon
copies, which she mailed before going home, to several
newspapers all over the country, inclosing a money order
in each to cover the cost of insertion.</p>

<p>"And now," she sighed, "I am happy. I feel better
than I have felt for some time...." She closed her
eyes meditatively, and thought of him. Would he survive?
Typhoid-pneumonia was a dreadful disease, and
she was considerably worried. When she retired that
night, she prayed a long prayer, and went to sleep with
a smile upon her lips, at peace with the world, and with
hopes for the best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>I Hope You&mdash;Won't&mdash;Won't be Angry</i>"</p>


<p>"We cannot give out information as to the condition
of the patient, Madam," said the informant at the
hospital, when Mildred had called to inquire regarding
the condition of her lover. She turned wearily away,
and went back to the office.</p>

<p>She was anxious to know the worst, if it came to that,
and was worried daily, until she could not restrain the
desire to visit the hospital each morning, before she
went about the duties she had preempted.</p>

<p>"He is not dead," she whispered to herself, "and if
I go each day, I can work with my mind at peace;
whereas, I would surely go crazy, if I were compelled to
go along, and not know whether he is living or dead."</p>

<p>Two weeks passed and he still lived, and at the end
of that time, she was advised at the hospital, that recovery
was expected, but that he would be, in all likelihood,
unable to leave the hospital under two months from
that date.</p>

<p>She went to the office that day in the highest spirits,
and was especially cheered to find a pile of letters in
answer to the advertisements. Replies were many during
the following days. In due course of time, she had
secured a large number of agents, and a greater portion,
upon following her instructions, were successful. Orders
for books began to fill the office, and after she had been
in charge of the office a month, she was pleased to see
that she was actually succeeding. Each mail brought
money and express orders, and then, the work being too
heavy for one, she looked about for a stenographer to
help her. She was successful in securing a very intelligent
girl, a creole, with French ways and a command of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
tongue which, at times, especially when excited, conflicted
with her English to a degree that was amusing.</p>

<p>As the days went by, business increased, until at the
end of six weeks, more than a thousand dollars was
finding its way to the office each week. Mildred was
encouraged, she was delighted. She deposited the money
to his credit in a savings account, and used only what
was necessary for expenses and for her own living. She
became so enthusiastic over the same, that she almost
forgot he would return, and then&mdash;but she got no further.</p>

<p>"He will be able to leave the hospital in two weeks,
possibly ten days," the informant advised her the last
day she called, which was eight weeks after he had
taken sick. It was only then that she became fully
appreciative of the position she held. She now became
uneasy, as, after thinking it over for some time, she
was unable to decide what to do. The business was now
so heavy, that it was impossible to be away from it;
money came in each mail, and sometimes in large sums,
while orders and inquiries for the agency, kept her
dictating letters for hours each day. She permitted herself,
that day and other days that followed, to become
the heroine in a wild dream. She saw him well, which
he would be soon, and she fancied how much she could
help him. But always, when she recalled the past, there
came a choking, and she would turn desperately to her
work in order to forget.</p>

<p>"And yet," she said to herself one day&mdash;and that was
only a few days before he was expected to return&mdash;"I
must do something. I cannot sit here and allow him
to walk in upon me, because&mdash;he, oh, I'm afraid he
might resent it."</p>

<p>One morning the mail was heavier than usual, because
it was Monday, and Saturday had been a holiday.
Springtime had come, with its time of blossom, and the
air was fragrant. She hummed a little tune and was
happy that day; happier than she had been for a long
time. She went about the great amount of work with a
calmness and precision, that resulted in finishing it
before five o'clock. Ordinarily, there was enough to
have kept them busy until the next day noon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Katherine," she said to the stenographer, "we
have been very industrious today, and I am going to
bring you something nice tomorrow. You are very
helpful," and with a quick impulse she kissed the other,
who returned it as affectionately.</p>

<p>In that moment, she almost felt inclined to tell the
girl the burden that was upon her, but she thought
better of it quickly, and, with a kind word, she turned
to her desk, and for a time listened to the other's footstep
in the hallway, where she moved occasionally, while
waiting for the elevator.</p>

<p>From a drawer she took some letters, and glanced
over them reflectively. They were letters from a girl
she recognized in the story, and from their tone, she surmised
that the other had once loved him. That love,
however, had changed in the course of events, and now
they were only friends.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time and gazed dreamily out over
the city, and then, suddenly, it occurred to her, that she
was sitting in the same position he had occupied, when
she had entered his office almost ten weeks before. She
stirred uneasily. At that moment a step sounded in
the hall, and came in the direction of the office. It
paused a minute outside the door, and then it was opened,
and some person stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>It was getting dark, and as the man paused, she
observed that he looked about the office strangely&mdash;doubtfully.
In so far as he knew, he had felt the office was a
thing of the past, and at this moment he muttered:
"Hump. Guess someone else is in this place." Presently,
with another muttering, he came toward the window.
Mildred sat stupified, and seemed unable to move any
part of her body. She felt strangely paralyzed. When
he got near the middle of the room, he suddenly bethought
himself of the light, and turning, he went to the wall,
where the switch was located, and pressed the button.</p>

<p>She had rearranged the office, that is, she had added
to the number of lights, since there were only two bulbs
when she came. Now there were six. Over the desk set
one, and it had a reflector. When he pressed the button,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
the room became instantly illuminated by the bright
rays, while the one on the desk reflected full into her
face.</p>

<p>She said something and turned her face, while he gave
a start and cried:</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>The next moment, he fell back and observed her
strangely. She sat as he had found her, with head
lowered and heart thumping violently. He advanced
after a pause, and stood close to her, regarding her with
a look that was stranger still. He appeared to be at a
loss what to say or do; then he raised his hand to his
forehead, while his gaze was one of utter blankness. It
occurred to her then, that he might be impaired in some
way, after such a severe illness. So, with an effort, she
rose boldly from the chair, and facing him, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I, Sid&mdash;Mr. Wyeth." She was compelled,
by the thumping of her heart, to hesitate for a moment,
and then she continued, more calmly: "I have made
bold to come here during your illness, and&mdash;and&mdash;take
charge of your work. I hope," she was now faltering,
while he was regarding her without understanding, from
the expression he wore. And&mdash;oh! She saw it now.
He was regarding her with disfavor. A frown played
about his lips that appeared drawn and thin, while his
eyes gradually changed until they were openly hostile&mdash;contempt
almost could be read. She turned her eyes
away.</p>

<p>This was her reward. She choked. Her brain became
a whirl for a moment. She had tried to help him, and
had succeeded. She had thought of it in that way;
she now strangely realized that she had not expected
any thanks&mdash;indeed, she had never thought of anything
but to make the business a success. And, she was positive,
that she had not expected any reward.</p>

<p>She was saying something. She was not fully aware
what it was, and her head hung down, while her eyes
sought the floor, instead of his face with the hostile
expression.</p>

<p>"I hope you&mdash;won't&mdash;won't be angry!" With a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
effort, during which she felt he was regarding her in the
same critical manner, although she was careful not to
glance into his face, she explained briefly what had
transpired during his absence. "And so," she concluded,
"here is everything drawn down to date," and with
that, she suddenly caught up her light coat, drew her
turban hat over her head, and went toward the door.</p>

<p>As she did so, she was aware that he had turned and
was looking after her. She paused when she reached
the door, and thought of his illness. He might take sick
again. She saw his eyes now for a brief moment, and
they were upon her. She could not read them altogether,
but it seemed as if the hostility was gone, and a
look that bordered on appeal had taken its place. Her
gaze lingered kindly, and then she said:</p>

<p>"You are ill&mdash;have been. Please be careful." And,
in spite of the effort it cost her to say it, she added:
"I will come again tomorrow," and was gone.</p>

<p>All that night she tossed and tumbled in her little bed
in Tunis. And when morning came, she dropped off to
sleep. Mrs. Jacques called her, and then came to the
room and knocked at the door. Presently, she ventured
to open it slightly. Mildred was snoring peacefully.</p>

<p>"She's tired, poor thing. Very tired." She looked at
her again. Her face was upturned and her throat was
exposed. A beautiful brown throat. She crossed the
room easily to where she lay, gazed down at her for a
moment, and became conscious again of that same
feeling that had been haunting her since she knew her.
She stopped presently, and drew the lace night dress
down a bit. The next moment she recoiled in fright.</p>

<p>"At last, oh God! At last I have found her! My
sister!" The other stirred. Light shown brightly through
the window, for it was seven-thirty, and the sun was
climbing. But Mildred Latham was tired, and was
snoring again in calm repose. The other bent over her.
She kept from putting her arms about her with much
effort, and then kissed her lips fondly.</p>

<p>She stood a few feet away, and regarded her with a
heavenly feeling, and then, drawing the blind until the
room was fully dark, she left her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_TEN_4" id="CHAPTER_TEN_4"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Vellun Parish&mdash;Jefferson Bernard</i></p>


<p>Sidney Wyeth sat for a long time at his desk after he
had looked through the statement before him. He could
not for some time understand how it had all come about.
He had been carried from the office unconscious ten weeks
before, and during that time, or when he had come back
into his senses after many weeks, he had concluded that
his effort, which had not gone very far, was doomed to
die, and had resigned himself to the inevitable. Now
before him was a statement, which showed that more
than a thousand dollars was finding its way to the office
each week, in excess of the cost of the books. More
than five thousand dollars was to his credit in a local
bank. What miracle had been wrought to make such a
profit in so short a time&mdash;or any time at all? It had
taken him two years to reach a fourth edition of this
book, while now the copies before him stated ninth edition.
How had it all happened?</p>

<p>There was but one answer, and that was, Mildred
Latham.</p>

<p>He lived over again the years of the past. He saw her
as he had met her on that first day. He recalled her
patience and appreciation, while he explained to her the
contents of the book, and the order she had given. He
remembered the dance and the kiss, with a strange pang
of the heart. In all his days, no kiss had seemed like
that. And the look in her eyes afterward. Was that
love? Surely that was life. If God, our Creator, made
that possible, then life was worth the effort. He became
so absorbed in his reflections, that he started when he
recalled his last visit.</p>

<p>After that it was different. But for that&mdash;but he had
worried himself sick, and had succeeded in forgetting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
and her until the day he took sick. He was too weak and
torn by the illness to think about the matter, while he
lay on his back in the hospital. But when convalescence
had set in, he had thought of it almost constantly. Try
as he would, he had been unable to understand how it all
happened. He pondered over it until he entered the office
an hour ago, and now it was all plain.</p>

<p>"Who is this girl?" he asked himself. "What is she?"
he demanded. "She has always puzzled me." But, at
the end of it all, the old hag on the steps, with the words
she had spoken, rose again before him, and he forgot&mdash;he
felt he was compelled to forget, all the rest.</p>

<p>He got up, after a time, and walked about the office.
He felt tired, and in view of her success, and of the circumstances
surrounding it, he would go somewhere and
rest, until he had thought it all out. But of one thing he
was certain, and that was he must never see her again.
He could love her; he could do anything within his
power for her&mdash;he was only too glad to; but he felt he
could never forget the few words he had heard a long
time ago.</p>

<p>So he wrote a letter to the effect that he had gone away,
but he did not state where.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Oh, I have overslept myself dreadfully," cried
Mildred, entering the kitchen where the other worked
away in silence.</p>

<p>"I started to awaken you, and you were resting
so quietly, that I desisted," Mrs. Jacques replied, regarding
her with a fond glance that the other did not
understand.</p>

<p>"I must hurry, for, of all mornings, this is the very one
I would not have been late for anything," and she
hurried through her breakfast and was turning to go,
when the other came up, threw her arms about her impulsively,
and kissed her long and lingeringly upon the lips.
Mildred returned the embrace, but she did not understand
the expression in the eyes of the other, as she took
her leave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>She arrived at the office, and was surprised to find only
Katherine working away on the books.</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;ah, any one been here?" she inquired, after
waiting to hear something from the lips of the other.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, no one," said the other, looking up in
surprise for a moment.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mildred, seating herself at her desk.
As she did so, her eyes fell upon an envelope with her
name written across it, and marked personal. She broke
the seal nervously. Calming herself, she straightened out
the folded sheet, and read it carefully.</p>

<blockquote class="small">
<p>
<i>Miss Mildred Latham</i>,</p>
<p class="ind">
<i>My Dear Madam</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>It is impossible to state how much you have done for the sale
of the book during my illness. I do not hesitate to say, that in
view of the fact that I have struggled over a period of two years,
with only a small measure of success, as compared to that which
has come about since you have looked after it, that it is beyond me.
I cannot, however, conscientiously accept it in the way you have
offered it according to your statement. So I have, therefore, made
over to you the sum total that you placed in the bank to my credit.</p>

<p>I am leaving the city for parts unknown, and may not return
for a long time&mdash;and possibly not at all.</p>

<p>Regretting that I cannot thank you more amply, but hoping you
will accept what is no more than due you, I am,</p>

<p class="midind">
Very sincerely yours,<br />
</p>
<p class="deepind"><span class="smcap">Sidney Wyeth</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>She laid the letter down and gazed into space for a
long time, not trying to understand anything. He had
gone, and left her. He had given her all she had earned,
and the privilege of earning more, but he had gone.
Would he ever return?... She was sorry now that
she didn't tell him all when it had been convenient; and
still, in the next thought, she was glad she hadn't.</p>

<p>She was not excited, but went about the work without
any outward sign that she had been the recipient of anything
unusual; but all the day through, she was thinking
of what had just passed. She could not recall what she
had expected, or that she had expected anything; but of
one thing she was more conscious than ever before, and
that was that she loved him with all her soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>So she decided to allow matters to drift along and made
no change.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Wyeth stood before the window of the city ticket office
of a small railroad. He was attracted by a parish which
appeared rather remote, but where a lake was advertised
as a nice place to fish. He made up his mind to go there.
It was a half day's journey by rail, and a train left in
two hours. He returned to his room, and an hour later
his trunk was at the depot. He passed near the building,
and from where he paused, he caught a sight of her
sitting at the desk where she had sat the night before.</p>

<p>He could go to her now, and say what had been on his
lips more than a year before. He gazed at her for a long
time, and was conscious of a longing. He had loved her&mdash;oh,
so very much. Indeed, she was everything he had
desired. Then he thought of the hag and what she had
said, and went his way to the depot.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Vellun Parish is perhaps the most remote part of the
state. It lies toward the southwest, and is bounded on
one side by the Gulf of Mexico. Its land is all swamp,
while no part of it is more than ten feet above the level
of the sea. The most of it is under perhaps a foot of
water. Upon the dry portion a few people live. They
make no effort to raise crops further than a garden, but
depend mostly upon fishing, and upon tourists for their
living. One railroad pulls through the mighty swamps
about it, and has a small station located on this dry
spot. It is many miles to another station. Almost
everybody leaves the place in summer, for mosquitoes
hold sway, while sickness and swamp fever are prevalent.</p>

<p>It was high noon at this resort, and from down the
track could be heard the whistle of a small locomotive&mdash;for
the trestles would not hold up large, heavy ones,
Presently, with a ringing of bells, it came to a stop before
the station, and two people got off, other than members
of the train crew. One from the rear, and the other from
the front of the Jim Crow car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter was Sidney Wyeth, and in his hands he
carried a fishing outfit and other matter, together with a
suit case. Before the station loafed a few of the inhabitants,
including an old man whose age was perhaps
sixty. He regarded Wyeth strangely, but returned the
nod curteously, when the other had spoken.</p>

<p>"Have any idea where I can find lodging about here?"
he inquired. It was at the end of the winter season, and
those who live the summer months through, had resigned
themselves to the heat and mosquitoes. The old
man surveyed Wyeth a moment critically before replying.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno exactly," said he at last, and Wyeth
was startled at his command of language, for in those
parts few spoke English, and when they did it was bad.
Creole was customary. The old man looked about a
moment before continuing, but presently he said. "I
live alone over beyond that clump of trees," and he
pointed to a grove that Wyeth saw plainly, "and if
you are alone, you might go along and look it over, and
if satisfied, why we might make a deal."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough," agreed Wyeth. "I'm alone,
and may be here a month, a week, or it may be three
months, I can't say."</p>

<p>"Very well then, follow me."</p>

<p>He took part of the luggage, and they went across one
of the few cleared spots of the parish. Finally they came
to a neat log house behind a paling fence, before which
a dog barked viciously. "Don, Don, hush the noise," the
old man said. "He won't bite, but he is fond of barking."
The dog now rolled on his back at Wyeth's feet, and they
soon became friends. Sidney patted his head and then
rolled him over, much to the dog's delight.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Governor!" cried Wyeth enthusiastically,
when they were inside, "but you're all fixed here, I
must say."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other, slowly and modestly, "I guess
it'll do for an old relic like me," and he laughed humorously.
Wyeth regarded him a moment, and then, for
the first time told him his name.</p>

<p>"And mine is Jefferson Bernard."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Bernard, I have always taken pride in the
fact that I am at home in the open," and he gazed out
the window across the cleared spot, and into the forest
that surrounded the house.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear that," cried the other. "I was under the
impression that you were one of the fly butlers who come
here with their people."</p>

<p>"No, I'm a sort of globe trotter, you might say. In
fact, at the present I have no plans whatever for the
future, so I might bunk with you here a few months.
Depends on how my mind is at the end of each day."</p>

<p>"Restless, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Have spent eleven years on the prairies
of Dakota, and very often, the 'Call of the Wild' gets
into my veins, and I want to get out where I cannot see
any one, and sort of&mdash;well, forget the strenuous ways of
life for a while."</p>

<p>Both laughed agreeably.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jefferson Bernard. "I bunk here alone and
do my own cooking of course, and hunt and fish and read
and sleep whenever I get ready."</p>

<p>Wyeth wondered at this man. About the wall everything
was clean, while the clothes the other wore were a
forest suit of brown cloth, with lace boots and a belt;
his hat was a broad brimmed Stetson. They were all
the best of material, and the man's appearance was
anything else but the back-woods Negro. He started to
inquire who he was, but something about the other did
not invite familiarity, so he talked on other topics instead.</p>

<p>He had been there two weeks, and had been over all
the part of the parish that was accessible, when one
of the periodic rainy spells set in. For days they were
unable to get outside without getting wet, and at times
they told a great deal about themselves.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," said Bernard, "that you
spoke of Cincinnati and that you came south from there,
a bit over a year ago. I, then, left there after you did."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Wyeth in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been down here a little over a year only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
I was reared in this same parish many years ago, and,
since then, I always had a longing to come back and
stay again until I got tired of it." He made himself
comfortable as he drew away on a long pipe; while
Wyeth, observing him, waited for the story he had to tell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I used to live in Cincinnati&mdash;in fact, I guess
that is what I might call home, if not this."</p>

<p>"This is news to me," said Wyeth.</p>

<p>The other smiled languidly, and went on:</p>

<p>"I used to live on Walnut Hill, and was employed by
Stephen Myer, a wealthy retired merchant, who not only
was well-to-do in Cinci', but owned a number of interests
in the south, in fact, he came to Cincinnati from the
south not so long before, and never went back again,
for he died.</p>

<p>"I was his valet for years. Got acquainted with him
right here in this parish one winter, when he was staying
at the hotel over there, and it was the second winter
when he hired me and took me north with him.</p>

<p>"Stephen Myer was a good man at heart, but a sport
until he died, and certainly believed in a good time with
the women. He loved his family, but he would run
around, which recalls his death whenever I think of it.</p>

<p>"He came back from the south about three years ago
I think, and it was not long until I knew he was keeping a
girl he had brought with him. I paid the matter no
attention, because he always had somebody before; but
strange to say, after that he had no other. It was kept
very quiet and I knew nothing of it,&mdash;that is, from him,
until the night he died. That took place while we were
at a hotel in Detroit. His death was due to heart failure,
but it didn't take him as it does most of its victims.
He was conscious that he was going to die, although he
was, to all appearances, well.</p>

<p>"It was then he told me the story.</p>

<p>"Calling me to his bedside, this is what he said. I
do not think I shall ever forget it, because it was such
an awful death. 'Jeff,' said he. 'I'm going to die.' I
looked at him, saying: 'Oh, you're frightened;' but he
shook his head in such a way that I became frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
and waited. 'Yes, Jeff,' he resumed: 'I'm goin' to die,
and Jeff, I'm going to hell,' I tried to soothe him,
but he only frowned slightly, and went on. 'Yes, Jeff,
I'm going to die and go to hell, because I deserve to go
there. I deserve to go there, Jeff, because I have sinned.
Yes, Jeff, I've committed an awful sin, and it's no more
than my due to burn in hell in payment. I never believed
much in such a place until not long ago, when I brought
that girl to Cincinnati.' He breathed deeply and with
some effort, and it was then I could see he wore a strange
expression, and now, as I look back at it, I guess that
meant death. He went on again, after a breathing spell:</p>

<p>"'Bring me that box over there Jeff, that one with the
key in the lock. I want to leave that one whom I have
wronged something before I'm done for.' I brought it
to him, and he unlocked it, and took therefrom a lot of
papers, and a certified check for twenty-five thousand
dollars, all made out, and to be turned over to her through
due recognition, as attested by his lawyers in Cincinnati.
'Hadn't I better wire for your family?' I inquired of
him; but he waived it aside, and said he didn't want
them to know until it was over.</p>

<p>"'Now, Jeff,' he went on, 'you are to take this envelope
to my attorney and see that you get their receipt of it,
after which, when you get back to Cincinnati, you take
this box as it is to her. I trust you, Jeff, and believe
that you will attend to it. And, too, I've left you well
cared for; but that is in the will, in due form. And now,
if you'll just give me a drink of water, I'll tell you the
story.</p>

<p>"'My company had their southern office in Attalia,
and we had quite a bit of business with the financial
department of one of the big denominations of Negro
churches. And that was how we came to become involved
in this deal. The financial secretary of the church
very often gave us his note in payment, and soon became
well known to me, and I liked him. Pretty soon, however,
it came to me that he aspired to be a bishop; although
the office he held was a good graft, and we knew it,
altho' the niggers didn't. But he became crazy to be a
bishop and a real big Negro, proper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p>"'About this time, it came to my attention that something
crooked, something underhanded was going on in
the affairs of the church. Well, one of the boys who
worked as porter, was reading a Negro paper one day,
and I observed that this financial secretary's picture
covered the whole front page. I took the paper, and when
I had read all the stuff he had written under another's
name, I began to figure what it was costing him to become
a bishop. Other extravagances came under my
observation, and, since the business we had with them
was becoming involved, I began an investigation regarding
the preacher. It developed that he had been married
twice&mdash;that is, the present wife was his second. The
first one had died and left him two daughters. My investigation,
which came through a Negro detective by
the name of Dejoie, although he was known during the
investigation as Edwards, developed that he was a
despot. His youngest daughter by his first wife realized
this, and she threw it into his face, and left when she
was thirteen, going to a place in Michigan where she
educated herself. The other was a girl with much sense,
but somewhat subservient to the old man, regardless of
the fact that she possessed a mind of her own. Apparently
it had been the old man's practice to have them regard
him as the great I am. She stayed with her father, who
lived with his second wife, and to that union were born
several children, I don't know how many.</p>

<p>"'Edwards uncovered all this and some more. He revealed
the fact that this preacher, who was so anxious to
become a bishop, was not only seeking it by extravagant
methods, but had employed the church's funds to the
amount of more than five thousand dollars. And still,
all those pig headed niggers knew nothing of it. It's a
great wonder they have anything, they seem to know so
little. My company was up against it for what was due
us; but that was not the end of it. On top of this, what
did that sinner do but write my name on a note for
five thousand dollars, and, through his standing with the
bank, got the money and covered the shortage before
those niggers ever knew there was any! Wasn't that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
limit? He was elected bishop, and became the big nigger
his great ambition had aspired to.</p>

<p>"'I was too put out to do anything at once, although
the note came due before I was aware it had been given.</p>

<p>"'The night I discovered it, was one when I happened to
be in my office alone. I decided forthwith to place it in
the hands of the law. It was then that this daughter
came to the office with a note from him, asking for an
appointment. I have an idea he was only then aware
that the note was due or past due. She caught me as
mad as a hornet, and I told her the whole thing. I shall
not soon forget the expression on her face when I had
told her. She looked like she would die right there. It
was then, too, I saw how beautiful she was and so well
formed. Suddenly a proposal entered my head. I have
always been impulsive, but I have never been known to
back up. So I got up and stood before her, and said my
say. She was terribly indignant and would have fled,
but I stood between her and the door. I became mad to
have that girl. She fought me, but I grew worse. I finally
said to her: "Come with me to Cincinnati, and save
your rotten, sinning preacher father from the chain gang.
A home it is up there with plenty of everything, or fifteen
years for your now bishop father on the worst chain gang
in the world." She regarded me wildly, as the substance
of it became clear to her. "Oh, I mean it," I cried. "I'm
going to send that dad of yours to the chain gang tomorrow&mdash;and
you know what that means." I think all the horror
of it rose before her in that moment. All the Negroes,
spiteful, envious creatures crying: "Aw, you're a big
nigger, huh. Your daddy's a bishop!" And the next day:
"Um-um! What do you think of it! A big bishop done
fo'ged a note!" And she had seen the chain gang. All
those stripes and chains frightened her. She looked up
at me with an appeal in her eyes that frightened me&mdash;even
then; but I was too wild to have her at that moment,
to give heed. And then she begged me to have mercy.
She cried and beseeched&mdash;she did everything, and then&mdash;in
the end&mdash;well, I'll not soon forget those appeals. "I'm
a nice girl. Can you not appreciate what that means?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
I will&mdash;to save my father and those little ones; but before
God: Hear him, please, see him. I may be yours
in body, but never in soul; while&mdash;oh, can't you see
what you ask? Can you not see that you take everything
I have lived for? Don't you see, that when you rob a
woman of her purity you have destroyed her womanhood?"
She fell on her face and sobbed until, as I see it now, I
can't imagine how I could have acted so.</p>

<p>"'And that is why, Jeff, I'm going to hell. Yes,
to hell!' He was going now, his eyes had a far away,
an unearthly expression; but before he was gone, he
said&mdash;and his voice seemed to come from another world
as I held him. 'I'm going, Jeff, I'm going. Satan's
waiting for me. And, say, Jeff,' his voice now came in
gasps, and sounded as if from eternity: 'I don't mind it
so much, no I don't, Jeff; but the only thing, and the
last request of God, is to be sure to send that old preacher
down to meet me sometime.' With that his muscles
relaxed, a spasm contracted his form, and he lay dead."</p>

<p>The two were silent now. Outside a bird hopped about,
and finally lit on the window sill, peering in as if to inquire
the cause of the silence. After a long time, it seemed,
Wyeth spoke.</p>

<p>"Strange. And did&mdash;you&mdash;ah&mdash;fulfill the request?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other slowly. "I did at once, and let
me tell you, my friend, I will never forget that girl's
face. Oh, I've seen many; but this girl's face told the
story, and her story was that of a pure girl, a good girl,
who had made a sublime sacrifice. Was that sacrifice
worth the cost?" Again silence reigned supreme, each
with his thoughts.</p>

<p>The birds outside made sweet music, as they flitted
happily about. Sidney Wyeth was speaking again, and
his voice was from a distance, as he said quietly:</p>

<p>"What became of her?"</p>

<p>"What became of her? Oh yes," cried the other,
sitting up and shaking off his distraction, as though he
had been awakened from sleep. "Why, she left soon
after. Came south, and when I was on the way down
here, I chanced to stop over in a town&mdash;I won't mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
the name&mdash;because she was there. Was selling a book,
so I understood, but was staying with the pastor of the
Presbyterian church, and high in their favor. I was glad
to see it and never let on; but there was a skunk aboard
the same train from Cincinnati, and who stayed there.
I've often thought about it since, and I hope that devil
never knew her and made trouble. She was a good girl,
and still may be saved if things go along right."</p>

<p>"Life is full of mysteries," Wyeth commented.</p>

<p>"Sure is," his companion replied, and then became
dreary, as his mind wandered sadly, solemnly, back into
the past. Suddenly he sat bolt upright, saying: "I trust
you, and for that reason, since I have told it to you, I
have a small picture that I found in the old man's effects,
and considered it good policy to remove. So I have
kept it, and I'm going to show it to you."</p>

<p>While the other fished away in an old trunk, a strange
thought came to Sidney Wyeth, and he recalled singularly,
the effort for the Y.M.C.A. in that town up the
river, and how twenty-five thousand dollars from a
source that no one could explain, was paid at almost
the last minute.... He was doing some thinking
and had forgotten all about the other, who had closed
the trunk now, and came before him with a small picture.
He sat up quickly when the other touched him, and held
before his gaze the picture of Mildred Latham.</p>

<p>And in that moment there came a vision of a dark,
dreary night, when he hurried through the streets of
Cincinnati, and came to a place where an old woman sat,
an evil hag; and who regarded him with malicious eyes&mdash;eyes
that appeared to hate everyone&mdash;and the words in
reply to his request, came back with a shock: "<i>Gwan!
She's with her man!</i>"</p>

<p>Sidney continued to gaze at the picture. There was
profound silence, for neither spoke. One was not in the
mood to do so, the other could not. He raised his hand
mechanically to his head, as though to rid his mind of
some obstruction. He tried to think coherently, but his
senses were confused.</p>

<p>He turned, staggered slightly, groping as if blindly, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
support, and passed on out into the open, and under
God's pure heavens&mdash;anywhere away from the stifling
air inside, and its hideous secret.</p>

<p>Sidney stood outside now, and the spring sun beat upon
his bare head, as, with his trembling hand he shaded his
eyes, and looked in the direction of the creole city.
Back there he would go&mdash;he had to go! He couldn't
say why&mdash;feel why&mdash;now. For, in the tangle of his confused
thoughts, nothing seemed clear. But, he would
go back. His hand sought his forehead again. Yes, he
would go back.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Let us go back to a night when the heroine of our
story got up from a drunken stupor, to find that the hour
of fate&mdash;fate for the Y.M.C.A. was at hand. She had
rushed breathlessly to the office of the Western Union,
and had secured the money that had been transferred,
at her request, from the Cincinnati bank some days
before. She had known when Wilson Jacobs returned
unsuccessful in his attempt, that some expedient was
necessary.</p>

<p>When she realized a year before, that she was heiress
to such a sum of money, she had worried as to what she
would do with it. Her conscience would never let her
touch a penny of it for personal use. It had been left
on deposit, and, insofar as her daily life had been concerned,
she had about forgotten it, until the climax of
Wilson Jacobs' great effort had stood like a spectre
before her.</p>

<p>For a time she had hesitated, feeling that such money
should not be used for Christian purposes.... But,
when she had awakened on that dreadful night, she
came at once to appreciate how, through her and her
alone, this effort should be realized.</p>

<p>So, she rushed pell mell through the streets that led to
Wilson Jacobs' home. As she hurried along, visions of
the great need passed fitfully through her mind. She
recalled all the crime she had witnessed; thousands
yearly herded on the gangs, torn mothers, prostituted
sisters, homes broken up by that demon of liquor. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
could see the condition which forced so many of her
people to the belief that colored people could never be
anything, regardless as to how much they might try.</p>

<p>Race prejudice, that demon of American society, had
succeeded in convincing so many of these weak people
that there was no future; that the only resort was to get
all the excitement out of life that was possible. How
they conducted themselves to secure such a life, was the
one great detriment to the race, to the city, to the
state, and in the end, to the United States.</p>

<p>As she rushed along, she could hear these poor creatures,
and the words they uttered, when approached with offers
for their salvation; for, in addition to the discouragement
caused by race prejudice, there was another feature
that was worse still&mdash;class prejudice. The folly of it.
The effect was more damnable, she knew, than all the
other causes, for, through it these poor creatures were
made to feel that they were actually bad; bad beyond
redemption, which made them unfit for the civilized
world. Under this they fretted. They grew likewise to
hate, and in the end, to become not only a disgrace to
the race, community and state, but even enemies to
society.</p>

<p>She recalled once a man, a mulatto and obviously a
pervert, who answered a street preacher. She could never
seem to forget his words.</p>

<p>"You say," he had said, "that I should get religion.
<i>and I say, what's the use</i>? I'm a <i>nigger</i>, and that means
I'm a vagabond, a cast-off, a thing to be hated, condemned
and persecuted. You speak of brotherly love
and the reward hereafter. I laugh when you make such
assertions. <i>Heaven for a Negro?</i> Why, do you suppose
that even Satan would care for him? As to brotherly
love, why don't you go to the white man that keeps my
sister? Why don't you tell that man what you preach
about? I am illegitimate. My youngest sister, the white
man's mistress, is too, and so are all the rest! Then you
speak of heaven and reward in the hereafter for Negroes.
The hereafter is the chain gang, where my illegitimate
brother is serving twenty years for murder. As for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
I'm going to a blind tiger and get a drink. I'm going to
get drunk. The idea that a Negro can be anything is a
joke. There may be a heaven for white people, but for
a Negro, oh, you fool!"</p>

<p>As all this and other instances passed through her
mind, Mildred became much excited. Then, as the
reality dawned upon her, a picture of what that money
could do became clear to her, and with Wilson Jacobs
as its secretary, she presently came to feel that her
sacrifice might be a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>On and on she hurried, until at last she came to the
house. She paused at the gate, and caught her breath.
Her thoughts were busy for a moment, as she tried to
formulate a plan to deliver the money without being
caught. She struggled nervously, with first one plan and
then another, and then at last she boldly entered the
gate and walked up to the front door. As she reached
to push the bell, she looked through the glass door.
Wilson sat nodding in the study. His position, she saw,
was such that he could see the clock, and watch the
fatal moments pass. It was then past eleven. She could
see the clock and realized what those moments meant.
He had, as she observed him, fallen asleep from sheer
fatigue. As she watched him, there came to her mind a
bold idea, and she put it into effect at once. She tried
the door, fearing it might be locked, but was relieved
when it opened with a turn of the knob.</p>

<p>She entered the house on tip-toe, passed through the
hall to the study, which was to one side, entered the
room in which he sat, and, with breath held, nerves
tense, she cautiously crossed to where he sat. She
slowly drew her breath, when she saw he was sleeping
peacefully. She placed the package containing the price
of her virtue upon the table. She looked at him again,
and caught her breath in fear, as he moved slightly, but
did not fully awaken.</p>

<p>The next moment she stole her way to the door, like a
thief in the night, and was outside. She turned, as she
heard a sound, and saw Constance, weary, tired, and
apparently nervally exhausted, come from the rear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
enter the study. She dared stand and watch her, as she
entered the study where her brother sat, now fully
awake, but oblivious to the presence of the package. He
was watching the clock that was ticking away.</p>

<p>With a catch of her breath, she saw that Constance
had discovered the package, and she saw them open it
with curiosity. She noted the look of intense joy, as
their eyes beheld the contents.</p>

<p>As she was leaving, these words floated out to her in
the stillness of night, "<i>Go, brother, in God's name, go!</i>"</p>

<p>No one, so far as we know, guessed where the much
needed money came from. But, strangely enough, the
giving had relieved the giver. After she left the Jacobs'
home, she felt as she had never felt before, and took
life and what it brought very calmly. As she passed
along, she looked with silent relief into the faces of
those of her race, who were persecuted on one hand by
fear of the superior white, and, on the other, by cast.
At times she had regarded them as so many dogs, lurking,
hungry dogs, who wait until darkness sets in, before
lurking in the alleys and searching garbage cans, expecting
to be kicked or be killed upon discovery, if, for no
other reason, simply to give vent to a hatred. They
felt, as she saw it, that it was the lot of the Negro
to be hated. They got no kindness; they expected none;
they even scoffed when it was offered, regarding it as
some subtle means of inviting them to a worse fate, and
this was what discrimination and prejudice had brought
them to.</p>

<p>There still remained the dispensation. No person in
all the world, she felt, was so fitted for the task as Wilson
Jacobs. Care of the building, after its completion,
would itself be a problem. Then there was that distrust
to dispell. Too often, she knew, that arrogance on the
part of the leaders of these institutions, had a tendency
to keep away from their doors the very class whom they
sought to attract. Unfortunately, the Negroes themselves
realized that those conditions were true.</p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs was not such a character. She felt
relieved as she realized this. When she thought again of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
her people, she appreciated what in time this genuine
Christianity of his would mean to them, when they came
to know him for the kind man he was. Her race was
emotional, superstitious, but withal, patriotic and enthusiastic.
Nothing, regardless of all she had seen, could
make her think otherwise. And what could be the
attitude of her race, her brothers, when they realized the
efforts made in their behalf? Will they say:</p>

<p>"You want to help me? You <i>really</i> want to be a
brother, and take me into that place and help me to
lead a good, clean life? And I doubted you! I scorned
your offer and cursed you and all society. Oh, merciful
God, but I knew not what I did! And you say, that
I am not bad, that I never was bad? That I was merely
weak&mdash;weak as other human beings were? Can all this
be true? I can hardly realize it. I have <i>never</i> known
kindness. I have always been told that life held no
future for me, a Negro; that by the will of our Creator,
I was born to be hated, hunted and abused, a creature of
no destiny, a thing to be spat upon and made a slave
of, a creature without morals. You say that all this was
wrong, and that I can be not only a good person, but an
example for the good of others? That I am, after all,
only the victim of circumstances?"</p>

<p>Wilson Jacobs would convince them, and, when this
was done, her reward would come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Mildred, I've Come Back</i>"</p>


<p>It seemed a long way back to the city, as though he
would never get there, and the train crept slowly along
through the mighty swamps. But all the way, his mind
was busy. Thought after thought came and went, but
only one became fixed. "I love her," he cried, again and
again. "I love her!" he exclaimed feverishly. "Nothing
else matters&mdash;nothing else <i>can</i> matter, now!"</p>

<p>He was going to her, just as fast as the slow train would
carry him, and when he arrived&mdash;beyond those conflicting
moments, he got no further.</p>

<p>He lay back in his seat after a spell, and calmed himself
to a degree that he could see it all clearly. He wanted
to see her now; he wanted to look deep into the eyes
that he was sure must be tired; he wanted to see behind
those mirrors, and to do his share to relieve the turmoil
within. After a time, his return to the office after his
illness, recurred to him. He had found a letter from the
publisher, and upon opening it, he had found it to contain
a draft for a large sum of money. He didn't know then
who had sold the book with so much success to him, and
he had wondered. Strange, but it had not occurred to
him then, that it was she. But now, it was all clear&mdash;everything.</p>

<p>"And it was Mildred all the while!" he exclaimed in a
controlled voice, despite the excitement it gave him.
"How could I have misunderstood so long!" And then
the instance of the five thousand dollars came back to him,
and the sale of his work as he had left it. True, he had
given this all over to her; but the fact to be reckoned
with was that she had succeeded where he had not.... She
had done this without any thought of herself.... No
girl with so much ability, with such constructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
thoughts, would have done as she had for others, unless
inspired by some divine sacrifice.</p>

<p>It was all clear to him now. And then the other.... In
all his life, virtue in women had been his highest
regard. During the months he spent in the south, he
had seen immorality of a nature that was revolting to
his finer senses. It had been the custom since the landing
of Negroes in this country, and was in evidence every
where, in the many colors that made up his people; but,
in spite of this, his high regard for the virtuous woman
remained the same. So, when the words of the hag came
back to him, amid all the good things he was thinking of
her, for a time, all was swept from him in a wave of
revolt.... How could he be blind henceforth to that?</p>

<p>He became weak and listless for a time. To pass on
through the city; to catch one of the ocean goers that he
was often interested in observing at the harbor, and go
to Argentina, Brazil&mdash;anywhere and forget it all; and
then there came to him the thought of his people. All
that he had lived through when he saw the leaders with
their selfishness, the neglect of their Christian duty;
how he had written of that selfishness, fearlessly with
jaws set and soul on fire; and of the reign of excitement
that followed&mdash;it was impossible to further contemplate
other plans.</p>

<p>And, amid all the chaos, there came to him thoughts of
the success of the Christian forward movement in the
town up the river. With success there, in the worst of
two towns in the world, it was now an almost foregone
conclusion, that shortly, the spirit would prevail successfully
in other towns. Yes, it would have to. The public,
for its own welfare, would soon come to appreciate what
such a movement meant to two-fifths of its population.
And how came this to be? Would the people of that town
up the river, now have a beautiful building in course of
construction, if it had been left to them to supply that
fatal twenty-five thousand? "Great God!" he murmured,
"how can I, <i>how can I</i>!"</p>

<p>And, as the train continued on its way over innumerable
trestles with lagoons and marshes everywhere, it occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
to him, that the one who had made all this possible, and
who, at the price of purity, which was a woman's all,
was now, and for the sake of it, homeless and friendless.... Even
that family, that bishop father, surrounded
by thousands of hero worshippers, with his
picture decorating the walls of thousands of homes, and
pointed to by day, would scorn her. The thousands of
young men, respectable, but poor, and who, for this
girl's sacrifice, were given a great chance to conduct their
future lives along Christian lines, even they would scorn
her. All decent and respecting society would scorn her.
<i>They would have to scorn her.</i> He himself <i>had already
scorned her</i>.</p>

<p>He allowed his gaze to wander beyond the waters of
a lagoon; until it rested upon a clump of trees that rose
ragged in the background. He was too torn with anguish
to think for a time. What price had been put upon
virtue, for his people&mdash;and her people&mdash;was too great to
estimate. But behind it all, was a homeless, friendless,
loveless little girl, drifting about in the world. For
Mildred Latham as he saw her again, was a mere girl,
not yet twenty-two. She had a heart, but what kind of
a heart must she have, after the suffering she had endured?
Yet she was a human being, with a human desire after all.</p>

<p>What he had seen in her eyes in Cincinnati; that pain,
and at times that wild, elfinlike, mad desire.... And,
oh, that caress, that one kiss that seemed to have penetrated
her very soul; the look she had given him; that
weak protest, afterward united in its pathetic appeal for
mercy.... She had been his dream; his mad desire.
He had declared then, that he would help to dispell that
worry; he had felt himself courageous enough to do so,
too; but now before him was the test, and he was weakening
under it.</p>

<p>Back in the <i>Rosebud Country</i>, he had lived alone for
years, and during those long days, his greatest desire,
his greatest hope, had been to love, to have that love
returned by his ideal of womanhood. He dismissed what
had followed. The other had not even courage enough to
accept graciously what he had worked for. Any woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
can, to a degree, mould the future of her husband. No
man, he knew, could be oblivious to the condition of his
household, and that which made it. That part of his
life, however, had long since been a closed chapter. His
great effort had been to forget it, and he had succeeded
to such a degree, that he was able to concentrate his
mind on other things; but now, it was different. Because,
with the exception of the one thing, Mildred
Latham was more than his picture, his ideal. But that
one thing was the silent barrier.</p>

<p>It was springtime now, and back in the <i>Rosebud
Country</i> all must be busy. He thought of the years, and
how busy he was at this time. And hopeful; because,
whether the season proved successful or not, springtime,
when the crops were planted, was always a hopeful time;
every farmer believed, as he planted his seed, that the
season would be successful. And now he was not there to
plant the crops. He had not been there the year before;
but, as he continued to recall the past, he knew that it
had never occurred to him that he would have been anywhere
else but there. He wanted to be there; but
financially, he couldn't afford to be there any more.</p>

<p>After an interminable spell of mental depression, something
came to his mind. It entered slowly, but at last
took shape. He whispered after a time: "Yes, yes, I
could. With that amount I could start all over again....
And out there, no one would know, no one would need to
know.... Just being there with the right to continue
as I once was; but with a terrible experience to remind
me of what it is all worth&mdash;it would not be the same now."</p>

<p>He saw her now differently. That other side was passing.
It would come back&mdash;it would keep coming back;
but it was his duty; it was his future&mdash;it was his very
life to crush it as often as it came up; but that was not
the half of it: Mildred Latham was homeless, and
friendless as we know. After what she had done for so
many others, was it not Christianlike to think of her?...</p>

<p>And now he had another thought. Yes, back in the
<i>Rosebud Country</i> it would be possible for two people to
be happy; people who had no other hope, no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
ambition, but to follow the pursuit of happiness and
labor....</p>

<p>As it became clearer, he realized that he had never
cared for conventionality. That other experience had
thrust it upon him, and when he showed his dislike for it,
he had been tortured. It would be different&mdash;now.
Mildred Latham would not care for any thing but himself,
and that which would make him happy.... And
he, his experience had been too real and too bitter, not
to appreciate what kindness, sincerity, and courage in
one's convictions, means in future happiness.</p>

<p>The train stood in the station now, and all the other
passengers had left the cars. He came out of his revery
with a start; and, hastily collecting his luggage, he
rushed forth, and caught a car that took him within a
block of his office. He deposited his grips in a cafe he
knew, and, a few minutes later, he stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, and nearly everyone in the
building had left for home; but she was there. Curiously,
he had felt that she would be there. With the amount
of business he had seen she had created, he was certain
that he would find her, and he did.</p>

<p>She sat at the desk, as she had the afternoon he had
returned from the hospital. She was working away, and
he saw her before she noticed him. When she did, she
gave a start, opened her mouth, and then, as if she
thought of something, closed it slowly, fumbled her pen,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>He paused briefly and observed her, and as he did so,
took note of the fact that she had lowered her head.
And he knew. It was in shame. Strangely now, since
she knew that he was aware of at least a part of the past,
she could not endure to have him look at her. But, in
these moments, Sidney Wyeth was not observing her in
scorn, as her colored cheeks gave evidence.</p>

<p>Mildred sat still and waited. She expected to be
scorned; she had come to a place in life, where she expected
anything. He might rebuke her, and she would
say nothing; but intuitively, she had never felt <i>he</i> would
rebuke her. As she sat with drooped head, he saw one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
tear drop unchecked upon her lap. No others followed;
but he knew the time had come to go to this girl. She
had endured a hard lot. Not one person in a thousand,
would have gone through what she had, but human
endurance, wrestling with all life's vicissitudes, has a
limit. How much it cost, that one tear, he could not
fully estimate; but, if he knew life, if some one didn't
come to Mildred Latham's rescue soon, she might become
anything. Not far from where she sat, a thousand or
more women were burning their souls in hell. And all
those women were there&mdash;not by preference; but because
they were simply human beings and weak.</p>

<p>He approached, and a moment later stood near her,
while her finger toyed with the pen. She had, as he
noticed now, grown stouter since he knew her in Cincinnati.
Her hair covered her head, and was beautiful to
his eyes, while her skin appeared somewhat darker. He
paused as one at a loss how to begin, because he had so
much he then wished to say. Presently he found his voice,
and his excitement was controlled as he spoke her name:</p>

<p>"Mildred," said he. She heard him, but did not reply.
So he repeated: "Mildred, I've come back." He paused
again, and the room was silent. She did not answer him,
and he did not expect her to. Presently he said it over
again. "Yes, I've come back.... I was away. I was
off in one of the parishes, one of the most remote, for, when
I left, I wanted to be away, away from everybody....
But it happened out there, that I met a man, Mildred.
I met a man ... and he told me a story, a long story....
What he told me, concerned something&mdash;something I will
not tell, and somebody I will not mention, but what he
told me, cleared the horizon.... And that's why I came
back. On the way I faltered, I weakened for a time. I
thought once of not stopping. I started to go on and on
and on, maybe never stop. But when I thought again,
and again, and kept on thinking, I couldn't. I couldn't,
because, well, after all, I wanted to stop.</p>

<p>"So I stopped, Mildred, and then, I came here. Here&mdash;and
to you.... I have come back, Mildred, and to
you. Are you glad I've come back, Mildred?" He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
paused and listened, though he did not expect her to
answer.</p>

<p>She remained as she was, and silent.</p>

<p>"On the way back, I thought of you, of nothing else,
no one else but you. My thoughts went back to our
acquaintance in Cincinnati, and the day we danced and
I&mdash;I&mdash;kissed you, Mildred." He paused again, and
gazed out over the rows of buildings below. "And then
I realized what has been wrong with me ever since, and
all my life.... It was because I have been hungry. I
have been starving to death these many years for love,
Mildred, love and understanding.... I am still hungry,
and thirsty; but at last a hope has come to me. A hope
that it will not long continue as it has these many years.
But withal, I have thought of something else too. And
that is, I want to go home. I want to go home to stay.
I don't like it here; I don't like it anywhere, but in the
<i>Rosebud Country</i>."</p>

<p>"The <i>Rosebud Country</i>?" she echoed, sitting erect and
turning slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mildred, The <i>Rosebud Country</i>." He paused
again, and the ticking of his watch was quite audible to
both. "Yes," he said presently, and after a time, in
which he seemed to be engaged in deep thought, he
resumed, "and I was going to say that I have decided to
go back." He moved and stood beside her. The sinking
sun now played a last evening ray across her face, and in
turning from it, she happened to look up and into his
face. He saw her now as he had never seen her before.
Something she saw caused her to catch her breath and
venture another look. His eyes appeared to see something
far away, and she continued to stare at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mildred," he started again, and now his voice
became low and strange. She understood, and knew that
he was living in the past, oblivious to her presence.
She listened with a strange rapture. "I've decided to
go back to that land beyond the Big Muddy. Back to
that little reservation, the name of which I love. But
Mildred, it depends." He halted and looked down into
her face. Their eyes met now, and both seemed hypno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>tized
for they continued to stare at each other, becoming
more enraptured. "It depends," said he, very slowly,
"<i>upon you</i>." She looked away, but he reached and
caught her hand. He backed up until he reached the
desk, upon which he seated himself. He looked at her
now pleadingly. She gave one glance, and caught the
same look she had seen but once before, more than a
year before, and before he knew. He pulled her gently
from the chair, and placed her beside him on the desk.</p>

<p>"It depends <i>upon you</i> Mildred!" And still she said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Out there, Mildred, I longed for you. Yes, it was you,
you! These many years I waited for you. At last I
have found you. Oh, I have found you, the <i>one Woman</i>.
And now," he said this in a strong voice, "I'm through.
I'm through, and ready to go back, if you will go with me.
Do you hear? I mean, that I love you Mildred. Love
you with all the passion of a hungry heart." He paused
again.</p>

<p>"And you have had a hard time, little girl, oh you've
had a hard time. I <i>know</i>. But it's all over now, dear.
Yes, it's all over now. There is no society that we are
under obligation to; there are no pretentious persons
to make us false to our convictions; there is nothing but
impulse to direct us."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sidney," he heard her say with a slight tremble.
His arm stole about her waist, and she did not remove it.
She looked up into his eyes and saw him with trust.
"And you'll go?" he said and waited.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it Sidney? Oh, Sidney, <i>do you mean it</i>?"
Her voice now was low, strained, strangely wistful, and
then, as if suddenly remembering something she had
apparently forgotten, her eyes took on an expression of
mute appeal, like that of a hunted animal. Her form
became tense, while a spasm of agony contracted her
features as she moaned:</p>

<p>"<i>No, No, No I can not. Oh, I will not!</i>" And
before he could quite understand her sudden rebellion,
she rushed from the room and into the hall, and soon
her rapid footsteps died away in the distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood as she had left him, not comprehending that
she had gone. "Am I awake?" he whispered dreamily
putting his hands together, and gazing at them stupidly,
as if to assure himself they were his own, "She has gone?
Gone, gone! Mildred&mdash;but&mdash;why?" He felt sadly weak,
for the strain was beginning to tell upon him.</p>

<p>In a half stupor, he finally found a seat in the office
chair, and mechanically let his gaze wander out over the
city. After a time, it rested upon a street that led down
to the wide thoroughfare. His eye soon caught sight of
a figure hurrying along the walk. He leaned forward and
observed it carefully, and when it reached another street,
he made out that it was Mildred. He watched her as
she crossed quickly to the center where a car was moving,
and boarded it. In a moment it had disappeared down
the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Slave Market</i></p>


<p>Days passed and still he waited, still he watched, and
still he listened, but in vain. And always he moved
about distractedly. He had no plans, he had no hopes
now, but was simply moving in a circle. At times he
would utter stupidly, "Where is she? Where is Mildred?"
And after that he would become silent; he would be
thinking&mdash;yes, always thinking.</p>

<p>He ransacked the office; he made inquiries to ascertain
where she stayed&mdash;but in vain. He knew not how
to look for her; he knew not where to begin. But the
work in the office&mdash;the result of her ability&mdash;continued to
increase. Mail was brought four times a day, and in
each, letters from far and near would contain money
orders, express checks, cheerful letters, and still orders
for more books. But they gave him no cheer, notwithstanding
he mechanically went about the work, with the
system he saw she had created.</p>

<p>And as the days went by, he grew more anxious, more
worried in regard to her fate, and he grew determined to
find her, if he could.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl. Poor little Mildred. Why has she
done all this? And she is alone somewhere&mdash;always
alone&mdash;and I know not where."</p>

<p>There came a day when he felt he could stand it no
longer.</p>

<p>He took a walk; he knew not where it led to. Possibly
it led nowhere. Yet he felt he must walk, not in the
direction he was accustomed to go (to the river, where
he had wandered many a night, and observed the mighty
ocean liners, receiving and discharging their cargoes; or
where, on the deck of packets, he listened to steam
calliopes), but in a direction he had never gone before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in one of the creole city's narrow ways, where
he presently found himself. Sidney strolled along, oblivious
to all whereabouts, and found that this part of
the city was much unlike any part he had known.</p>

<p>He felt as one in a strange land, to be sure. On all
sides he was greeted by little low houses, opening into
the narrow streets. Peculiar people moved about and
spoke in a tongue he could not understand, but he knew
it was creole. They were quieter than those in the
neighborhood he lived, and he understood. They were
all Catholics, he had been told, and "obeyed" the priest.
He was glad of it. He wished all his race would obey
something other than their animal instincts.</p>

<p>He paused at last before a statue in a small square.
Four rows of buildings faced it on that many sides.
Only one side confronted him, however, and to this he
finally went. He stopped before a large church, a cathedral,
and read that it had been built almost two hundred
years before. Next to the church, was the museum.
Curious, and for a time forgetting his troubles, he wandered
in. He went up a winding stairway to the second
floor. As he passed upward, great oil paintings greeted
him. All old, this he saw; for, under many were inscriptions,
showing that many had been painted more
than a hundred years ago. While he had never studied
this art, he readily appreciated that many were wonderful.
Elegant ladies gazed at him from the frames, their
eyes following him strangely out of sight; for, no matter
where he stood, whether in front or from either side,
they seemed to scrutinize him.</p>

<p>He passed into the museum and began to examine,
through the glass cases, relics of another day. That the
city was old was shown by the age of papers and documents
of numerous mention. Pictures of fond old
mammies, gray and white-haired old uncles, grand
dames (such as Dixie had seen), caught his attention
everywhere.</p>

<p>An old, old man, scion of a decayed aristocracy, sat in
a chair within this art room, and Sidney approached him.
"Have you," said he, "any record of the sale of slaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
in this museum?" The other pointed to a room Wyeth
had not observed, but spoke no word.</p>

<p>Wyeth wandered into it, and his gaze immediately
encountered what he was curious to see.</p>

<p>"Know all men by these presents:</p>

<p>"Being the last will and testament of Joan Becuare.</p>

<p>"To my wife and life companion, I do bequeath to thee,
all I have after death. To-wit:</p>

<p>"One thousand acres of land in Caddo Parish, unencumbered.</p>

<p>"One hundred niggers, of various ages and the
following description:</p>

<p>"One mammy, age eighty. A better wench never
lived. Name: Diana.</p>

<p>"One 'uncle', eighty-seven, beloved servant of his
master, and faithful ever. Name: Joe.</p>

<p>"One wench, twenty-two, robust, healthy, a good
servant of the house. Name: Martha."</p>

<p>And so on the description ran, which seemed strange
and unnecessary in a will; then he recalled the sentiment
of the southerner.</p>

<p>In still another case, he read a sale bill, written in
long hand with an artistic flourish:</p>

<p>"Having sold my plantation, I will hereby sell to the
highest bidder, at public auction, the following named
property, to-wit:</p>

<p>"One nigger wench, sixteen years, hail and hearty,
promises to be a good breeder, and is now with child by
Ditto, a young nigger, strong as a lion, healthy and a
good worker. Not 'sassy'.</p>

<p>"One nigger wench, twenty-three, name, Mandy.
This is the most attractive wench in Gretna Parish.
She is expecting a third child soon."</p>

<p>Wyeth wondered why the father was not mentioned.
And then he thought of something, and knew.... His
own father was the son of a master.</p>

<p>He read other such documents, and then observed
that almost all sales were recorded to be held at the
"slave" market. After an hour or more, he passed out.</p>

<p>He went up a street, which was narrow&mdash;like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
those in the old section of the city, and walked
on, whither he had no idea. Not far away, he could see
the river and many great vessels moving up and down.
Just ahead of him, appeared an odd, long, two-story
building. The first glance revealed that, once upon a
time, it had been a grand affair. "Wonder what it was?"
he muttered idly.</p>

<p>And now he came up to it, and paused near one end.
He viewed it many minutes curiously from across the
street, but he could not make out what it had been.
As he saw it now, it was evident that it had been empty
for many, many years.</p>

<p>Presently, he crossed to where a door greeted him,
only to find, when he had come to it, that it was bolted
from the inside, while the heavy iron knob was rusted
until it was hardly recognizable. He glanced up, and,
straining his eyes, he read an inscription over the door:</p>

<p class="center">
ST. LOUIS&mdash;ROYAL HOTEL</p>
<p class="center small">SLAVE MARKET
</p>

<p>"So this is the place," he whispered, observing everything
before him now with a new interest. "Herein
were sold, in the days of old, hundreds&mdash;aye, thousands
of <i>my</i> people." He passed to the street upon which the
hotel faced for a block, and walked down this, observing
the decaying structure with greater curiosity. The entire
building was, apparently, empty. A porch, supported
by massive iron pillars, reached over the walk, the entire
length of the building. The large windows of the second
story were without glass, and gaped darkly, seeming to
tell a story which he would like to have known. The
lower floor had evidently been given over to business
purposes, judging from the wide windows that now
were boarded over with two-inch planks. All this was
decorated with stage announcements.</p>

<p>When he reached the other end, there was an opening;
the door was to one side, and, more curious now than
ever, he paused, and gazed into the dark interior. Soon
he passed within. The place seemed almost as dark as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
a dungeon at first, and he stood for a minute, until he
had become accustomed to it. He passed into the
interior, and finally came into a room that was perfectly
round. "An arch chamber, or what?" he conjectured.
Out of the gloom a block arose. Something about it
attracted him, and he crossed to where it was fitted into
the wall. At one side he now read, "Sheriff's desk."
On the other side he read, "Clerk." And now he looked
at the block, and knew that it was on this <i>his</i> people had
been sold&mdash;at auction. He closed his eyes for a time,
and allowed his thoughts&mdash;his imagination&mdash;to go back
into the past, when rich planters, grand ladies, and
harsh overseers once held sway. And before him rose a
picture.</p>

<p>"Hear me," the auctioneer, "I now offer the best
nigger that ever held a plow. A good, strong rascal,
that is worth:&mdash;How much am I offered to start him?
How much am I offered to start him? Five hundred!
Who is insane, or jokes? Five hundred for a nigger like
this? Nonsense! Now, here, come forward, and feel
this nigger's muscles, examine his teeth, strike his breast."
And, to emphasize his good, robust property, he struck
the slave a resounding lick across the breast, that would
have knocked over half the people before him. Wyeth
could seem to see the man, the black man, merely smile
at all the faces about him.</p>

<p>"And now I am going to offer you something that will
arouse you. Bring forward the wench, the pretty young
wench."</p>

<p>A young mulatto Negress now stood before the crowd.
A stirring, a collecting near the front, a crowding about
the block; some almost getting upon it, in their excitement.
A murmur went the rounds, and words could
be heard. "I'd like to own her!" There was a consulting
of bank books, a figuring of credit, and then the
auctioneers voice was heard again.</p>

<p>"Look at 'er, look at 'er! Ha! A fine one, eh? Yes,
a fine one.... Look at her form.... Look at her face!
Here, bright eyes, hold up, hold up, and let the boys
see what I have got.... What am I bid?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>

<p>"$1000."</p>

<p>"Say! The man that made that bid ought to be
hung! A thousand dollars for a wench like this? Why,
by all the pious gods, she is worth that for a year...."</p>

<p>"$1500."</p>

<p>"$2000."</p>

<p>"$2500."</p>

<p>"$3000."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," said someone, and Wyeth came back to the
present, to look down upon and old, white-haired woman,
who was standing, observing him from the doorway.
He bowed apologetically, got down, and went toward her.</p>

<p>"I have charge of the building," said she, speaking in
a little strained voice. "Would you not like to view
the interior?"</p>

<p>"I should like to, I am sure," he replied.</p>

<p>He followed her back to the door through which he
had entered, and up a flight of winding, iron stairs to
the next floor. Even these, he saw, had once been
most magnificent. His guide offered no comment, but
caught her breath in gasps as she ascended. When the
landing had been reached, both paused for breath, while
Wyeth's attention was immediately caught by the
decaying grandeur, that was evident all about him.
"Wonderful," he said at last, in a low, respectful voice,
and as though he feared to disturb some of those grand
persons that once had frequented it.</p>

<p>"Wonderful, you say?" echoed the woman, and
regarded him out of small, sharp eyes.</p>

<p>"Magnificent."</p>

<p>"And, be you a stranger in the city?" she now asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And from where do you come?"</p>

<p>"The great northwest. Dakota."</p>

<p>"Ah, Dakota&mdash;m-m. That is far, far away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; far, far away."</p>

<p>"I have never been there. I have never been anywhere,
but have always lived here in Bienville Parish.
I was born here, a creole."</p>

<p>They now walked down the wide hall, and where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
gazed into the deserted rooms on either side, all of which
revealed a once great splendor.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, "is a room that once played a
conspicuous part in the old south." She led him then
into a large room, much larger than any other in the
building. It was a round room, and he could see that it
had been made to be used for convention purposes.
She was explaining.</p>

<p>"It was once used as a temporary capitol, and later
as a rendezvous for secessionists. And still later, after
the war, Sheridan made a raid, and arrested many conspirators."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Sidney, "that this place has seen
many grand occasions?"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed it has. All the aristocrats of the southland
always stopped here, as well as counts and dukes
and lords and great ladies, and still from South America
and Mexico the best people stopped here."</p>

<p>They passed out of the room, across the hallway, and
entered another room that was furnished. "I live here,"
said the woman, to his surprise.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, alone for many years."</p>

<p>He understood now, and, running his hands into his
pockets, he pulled forth a half dollar, and handed it to
her. She accepted it with many thanks, and gave him
then, some pictures and relics.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have many visitors&mdash;tourists?" he
inquired, starting toward the door.</p>

<p>"Well, no, I do not," she said, somewhat regretfully.
"The people do not seem to wander down into this
section. They do not appear curious for relics, as they
used to be."</p>

<p>"That's too bad&mdash;for you," he said kindly.</p>

<p>"It is, since I am old, and have no other way of getting
my living," and she sighed.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-nine."</p>

<p>"And you have no&mdash;no children?" he asked now,
with curious interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>"None. And that&mdash;and that, perhaps, is why I'm
like I am today...."</p>

<p>Wyeth listened kindly, patiently. The other appeared
sad and reminiscent.</p>

<p>"No, I shall never seem to get over it, either. I am
the last of a family that came here from France, many,
many years ago&mdash;two hundred, to be exact. For many
years, we were the richest family in Bienville Parish,
and perhaps almost as rich as any other in the state.
We owned land, and slaves, until we could hardly count
them. Of course, the war meant&mdash;you can understand
what we lost with the freedom of the blacks. But after
that, we were still immensely rich. But, somehow, a
curse seemed to come over the family. No boy babies
were born to any. The girls became subject to consumption,
until all had died but myself. Then I married.
My husband was Spanish and French, very affectionate,
and was good to me, and we were hopeful and happy&mdash;until
I bore him no offspring. He grew crabbed, nervous
and impatient.</p>

<p>"Before long, I came to see that he was intimate
elsewhere. He began to drink, to gamble, and to carouse.
He stayed out until all hours of the night, and then he
got so he would not come home at all. For days I would
not see him, and then for weeks." She paused long
enough now to wipe a tear. "I began to fear for him,
for, I recalled that his ancestors had come to abrupt ends,
and I worried. Because I could bear him no children,
I gave him freely of the fortune that was left to me.
He ran through with his, and then with mine." She
was weeping quietly now, and he felt inclined to comfort
her, but did not know how.</p>

<p>After a time she was calm again. She took a seat by
the window, and gazed with a tired expression out into
the street, while he waited. "Well," she resumed, "they
brought him home one day, dead, and I have been alone
since."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Wyeth, and shifted about, listening
for more, for, carefully observant, he saw that she was
not through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>"One day, there came a woman, an attractive colored
woman, with large eyes and the most beautiful hair and
skin and form I had ever, I think, seen. She led a little
boy by the hand, and when he looked up at me, I
screamed. I knew then, and didn't have to be told,
that he was my husband's son.</p>

<p>"Strangely, I was happy. To know that my good
husband&mdash;for he had been good in the beginning&mdash;had
left his name, somewhat cheered me, and we agreed to
educate and give him a chance.</p>

<p>"We placed him later, at my expense, in a good school,
and he grew to be a handsome, bright-eyed young man.
I watched him, however, with a slight fear&mdash;for I remembered.
But he made a man of himself, a successful man,
and with the last few thousands I could gather, I helped
to start him in business, and in due time he had made
a name that was an envy. He became the owner of
much of the best property in the city, land in the northern
part of the state, and, in the end, married one of the
wealthiest and most attractive girls in the town." She
paused again, and Wyeth listened without a word.
Something remained yet to be told....</p>

<p>The woman was speaking again.</p>

<p>"Yes, he grew to success and happiness&mdash;and then,
well, something happened."</p>

<p>"Something happened?" Wyeth echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes. Something happened." She was silent now,
and gazed again out of the window.</p>

<p>"Heredity."</p>

<p>"Heredity?" And still he did not understand. He
could not be patient longer. "Who was this man&mdash;that
is, ah&mdash;what was his name. I don't think I ever heard
of him&mdash;a colored man?"</p>

<p>She looked straight at him now, without a change of
expression, and answered: "He was not colored!"</p>

<p>"Not colored?"</p>

<p>"I should have said," she corrected, "that he didn't
go as colored.... He <i>passed</i> for white."</p>

<p>"Oh...."</p>

<p>"But that was not it&mdash;heredity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p>Wyeth said nothing.</p>

<p>"He ran around. He took up drink&mdash;and then he
wanted&mdash;colored women."</p>

<p>After this, both were silent for a long time; but Wyeth
was thinking. He was hearing over again what he had
heard before&mdash;many times. "<i>Colored women!</i>" In Dixie,
he felt that if he could keep his ears deaf to hearing of
white men&mdash;and those who "passed" for white&mdash;wanting&mdash;and
having&mdash;colored women, he could, he possibly
might like the country; but everywhere he had heard
this. The woman broke the silence.</p>

<p>"This city is possessed with that desire. Have you
observed it&mdash;everywhere you might chance to look, you
will see it?"</p>

<p>He sighed. She looked at him again, and then became
silent.</p>

<p>Across the way, a large, municipal building rose far
above St. Louis&mdash;Royal Hotel&mdash;Slave Market. Through
the window from where they sat, busy clerks worked
away over books. When their eyes glanced to the
street, it was broken with automobiles, and busy people
hurrying to and fro.</p>

<p>"I have a visitor," he heard the woman say. "She is
a sweet, kind, but sad sort of girl. She has been to see
me several times of late, and I have been talking religion
with her. In all my days, no human being has interested
me as she has. I love her. And while I can't object,
I regret to feel in some way that she is going to enter
the convent, and become a sister."</p>

<p>"Are you a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"All French are Catholic," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then you perforce sanction this intention of your
girl friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; but, oh, how much I shall miss her!"</p>

<p>"Will she enter soon?"</p>

<p>"Very soon!"</p>

<p>"Have you known her long?"</p>

<p>"A few months; but it seems I have known her all
my life."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;what is she, colored or white?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colored."</p>

<p>"Indeed. Her name?"</p>

<p>"I have it; but I forget. I call her always Little Sister.
I have her picture and will let you see it. She had it
taken a few days ago, out there on that grass plot,"
and she pointed to the yard of the municipal building.
She was a few minutes finding the picture, and then
Wyeth was overcome by a strange feeling, with regard
to what he had heard. A girl ... sad ... going to
enter a convent.... Who was this girl? Who, who,
who?</p>

<p>"Here is her picture," said the woman.</p>

<p>He took it, and saw Mildred smiling up at him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Restitution</i>"</p>


<p>"I had to," cried Mildred bewilderingly, as she hurried,
hatless, breathless, along the walk, when she left her
lover so abruptly. She was distracted; she was not
fully aware of what she said. All she knew was, that at
the most supreme moment of her existence, she had
broken away from the one she loved, and for whom she
would have been willing to die; but to marry him at
last, she felt she could not conscientiously do. "Oh,
but it was manly, kindly&mdash;sublime, his offer, and how
I love him for it!" she whispered. "I know he will
forgive me; he will remember me kindly; he will never
forget me, and my love for him&mdash;but to go to him and
make him suffer with the thought of the past&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>She slowed down, as she neared the wide street, that
crossed just ahead of her. She crossed the walk to the
center of the street, where a car was coming, and caught
it. Once inside and seated, she lay back, and became,
for a time, dully listless. Presently, she saw the river
just ahead, and when the car slowed down, she left it,
crossed to the ferry, and went aboard. A half hour
later, she was in her room.</p>

<p>Her sister greeted her pleasantly from the garden,
which aroused her emotion to such a degree, that she
choked slightly, in order to hold back words she had
long wished to say.</p>

<p>When alone at last in her room, she lay across the
bed, and gave up to the feeling of inertia, that had taken
possession of her.</p>

<p>All that day she remained so. She could scarcely
collect her wits. Again and again, the events connected
with his return, flew through her dull, sluggish mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
and, at last, to relieve it, she dressed in a cool, thin
dress, and went for a walk down by the river front.</p>

<p>She passed many docks, where not so many steamers
lay at anchor as she had once noticed. She wondered
why, since she had observed the falling off of traffic.
Then she thought about the bloodshed that was going
on each day across the water. She soon came abreast
of a wharf where more than a score of great ocean goers
were anchored. No smoke came from their funnels;
no men worked away on their decks; in fact, they were
as silent as the grave, their dark hulls casting a dull
shadow above the water. She wandered down the
board platform, and studied them idly. Then she read,
painted on their sterns, names with Bremen and Hamburg
as their port.... Her thoughts again reverted to
the carnage across the waters.</p>

<p>She found the street again, and wandered aimlessly
along the sidewalk. Suddenly she halted and strained
her ears, as a sound came to her from some distance.
She listened, and then looked up and across the river,
where the creole city stretched, apparently endless,
before her. She observed in doing so, for the first time,
that the river curved in such a manner as to form a
perfect crescent at this point, and, although her thoughts
were confused, she did not fail to appreciate the beauty
of it.</p>

<p>Her gaze had found the place from whence came the
sound that had halted her. It was the bell of a church
vibrating through the still evening air. The steeple in
which it was mounted, raised far into the air above the
buildings about it, and she watched it with growing
reverence. As she continued to stare at it, it seemed to
outline a mighty sepulchre, and she fell to speculating
about it. She was familiar with it, in a measure, and
recalled, as she found herself wandering vaguely along
a few moments later, that she used to pass it each day.
It was when <i>he</i> lay ill at the hospital, that it was near.
It was called St. Catherine. She had happily observed
that may little colored children went to it each day, and
Sunday. Their training, she had observed, was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
different from the denominations with which she was
acquainted. She had stopped before its steeple the first
time, one day toward the close of Sidney's recovery.
The next day she had entered it, and wandered down its
carpeted aisles. She had gone up to the front, before she
realized that any one was in the church. And then a
sister came from an alcove, or from some place, but she
could not imagine where.</p>

<p>She had halted embarrassed, but the other smiled
upon her so pleasantly, that her confidence was won in
a moment.</p>

<p>Mildred recalled it&mdash;the meeting&mdash;strangely today.
She wondered what the life of a sister was like. She had
guessed what it meant.... She had almost forgotten the
sister, until she went her way this day, when the lot of
those patient souls came to her mind again.</p>

<p>She reached a street presently, where two wide walkways
intersected, and when she reached the center of
the intersection, something gripped her and she stopped
quickly, catching her breath. She continued to stand
thus, but with eyes widening, nerves tense, and then
she uttered beneath her breath: "Why not? Yes, why
not? Why, why, why?" Then, completely absorbed in
the idea, which had suddenly come to her, offering, as
she felt it now, a solution of her life, she turned on her
heel, and retraced her steps homeward.</p>

<p>And all the way she kept saying to herself: "Why not,
why, why?"</p>

<p>She hesitated at the gate, and again there came to her
ears from across the river the chime of the bell on St.
Catherine. It echoed softly, and vibrating, it touched
her soul to its depths. She stood at last transformed.
As it continued to float across to her, she seemed to
translate: "Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden,
and I will give thee rest."</p>

<p>When she entered the house, her head hung, with eyes
cast down. She had decided to become a sister.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There came a day, bright, clear, and slightly breezy;
but withal, invigorating, and she went to visit the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
woman who lived alone in the deserted St. Louis&mdash;Royal
Hotel. She had no tremors, because it had been the
place where once her people were sold by thousands.
She had met the old woman on one of her frequent
pilgrimages alone in the creole city, and had become
strangely fond of her. Mildred had, on more than one
occasion, felt constrained to tell her the story.... So
today, she came quietly upon the old soul sitting by the
window, with the light streaming in upon her faded hair
and features.</p>

<p>"You come today, Little Sister. I am always so glad
to see you."</p>

<p>Mildred returned the greeting kindly and pleasantly,
and sank into the proffered chair. She had told the
other of her intentions, but offered no reason for her
decision. She asked today that the other bless her,
which was done. They sat afterward in mutual silence.
Presently, however, the other broke it.</p>

<p>"A young man was here yesterday, a strange, kind,
forgiving sort of fellow. He aroused me in a way; he
brought back, by his presence, memories, and I don't
know why; but I told him my story.... He listened so
patiently, so kindly, and with such sympathy, I do
declare, that I wept."</p>

<p>"A young man? A&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A young colored man from away off in the great
northwest."</p>

<p>"Sidney, oh, Sidney," Mildred breathed, unheard.</p>

<p>"And do you know, dear Little Sister, I thought of
you almost all the time he listened, and was near me....
I don't know why. I cannot imagine predestination in
a large sense; but in some way I felt he suffered." She
paused, and Mildred swallowed. After a time she said,
in a small voice:</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go now."</p>

<p>The other did not detain her, though she wished she
would never leave, but followed her out of the silent old
place down to the street, and watched her out of sight.</p>

<p>She passed through one of the narrow streets to the
banking section of the city, entered the one where Sidney's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
money was deposited, which he had given back to her,
and she had it made into a draft. This was mailed forthwith
to him. Then she recrossed the river, and when in
her room, packed all her belongings securely, and then
wrote a long letter to her sister. In this, she told of her
life from the day she had left home on the mission ... omitting
why she had done this ... up to the day.
She wrote that she loved a young man, loved him, so that
she could not bear to become his, and feel that she was
guilty&mdash;unworthy. She closed it, asking her sister to
accept all she left&mdash;which was everything, but what she
wore.</p>

<p>She retired, for night had come, and slept so peacefully
the night through, that she was surprised. She dressed
before the others arose, and slipped into the street.</p>

<p>In due time, she stood at the gates of St. Catherine.
It was still early, and the people were not much astir,
when again the chimes came to her ears, a hundred and
more feet above her. She listened, and as they continued
to ring, she gradually became transformed. No
one came, so she entered the gate, went around to the
side, and took a seat.</p>

<p>Her mind became reflective and reverted to the past,
and she found herself living it over, again and again.
But, as she reviewed it, she seemed to have no regrets;
she did not foster the kind of hopes she once had, and
then she arose and found her way again to the front.
She approached the door, and when she tried the knob,
found that it was open. The priest was just leaving
through a side door as she entered, and did not hear her
footfall, as she passed lightly down the carpeted aisle.</p>

<p>She stood before the altar, when she had come to the
other end, and getting down upon her knees, offered a
silent little prayer. She remained there until the flood
of emotion&mdash;for she found herself peculiarly emotional
today&mdash;had passed, and then arose. She gazed at the
emblem of the Christ before her for a moment, and then,
turning, she walked into Sidney Wyeth, who had come
upon her, and was waiting while she was in prayer.</p>

<p>"Mildred," he said, and his voice came low, even, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
respectful. "I know...." This was all he said; but
the hungry look in his eyes told all else....</p>

<p>She halted before him without any undue excitement
in her manner, but her eyes were downcast. She recalled
even now, that she had never been able to return his
piercing gaze. She kept her head bent, with her small
hands folded before her, but listened with something
akin to a heavenly rapture. He was speaking again.</p>

<p>"I am not going to infringe upon your liberty by
asking you to give up what is your intention. I've
come, Mildred, just to see&mdash;to look into your eyes once
more, before you go your way.... That is all I ask.
You will grant me that, won't you, Mildred?" They
stood facing each other, only a few feet apart. He held
his hat crushed in his hand, while she did not release her
grip on the cross she held. He watched her, as she
slowly raised her head, as her eyebrows came slowly
into view, and then at last her eyes.... They looked into
his now. His looked into hers. Slowly, they spoke&mdash;both
pairs of eyes. No words passed their lips, but each
could seem to hear a soul within crying: "<i>Restitution!
Restitution!</i>"</p>

<p>How long they stood thus, they did not know. But,
after a time, something seemed to break the spell. Perhaps
it was the departed souls. They knew not, were
not even aware of what was passing. Still, the eyes of
each, hypnotic, struggling with the fire of incarnation,
slowly drew them nearer. They were at last near each
other. Their breaths came in strange, tender gasps.
Their eyes continued to see and regard each other in
that heavenly rapture. And still no word was spoken.</p>

<p>His hands seemed to find hers and the cross. They
gathered them and held them fast, while out of her ethereal
eyes he saw a divine glory never to be forgotten. Then
his left arm rose. It slowly encircled her form. They
heard now, each others heart. And then something
else seemed to guide him. His head went down, while
his eyes still looked into Mildred's with that peculiar
enchantment. He placed his cheek against hers, with
gentleness and reverence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>

<p>When the good father came again into the church, he
paused as he watched a couple pass slowly down the
aisle. They were a man and a woman. His arm rested
about the slender shoulders of his companion, with great
tenderness.</p>

<p>So together, they went to that land in the west.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
